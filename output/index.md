I'm **Hasanth**.

In this [blog](https://jeanbourgain8.github.io/), I write articles on topics - ***Theoretical Computer Science, Maths, Competitve Programming, System hacks & other technical stuff,*** which I expect would serve both as - an account of my thoughts, progress & also as a comprehensive knowledge resource, for the interested. 

In addition, I also publish on [Substack](https://jeanbourgain8.substack.com/), on topics of more general concern - ***Public Policy, Economics, Psychology, Books etc.,*** some of them are for free to read & for the rest you need subscribe. If you like my content & wish to read more, you can subscribe below.
