&lt;h2 id="statement-of-purpose"&gt;Statement of Purpose&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id="1-introduction"&gt;1. Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To my fortune, I found a great &lt;strong&gt;opportunity&lt;/strong&gt; in &lt;strong&gt;Sept'2022&lt;/strong&gt;, which was the same month in which I gave my UPSC-CSE (Mains) Exam in 2022. This &lt;strong&gt;opportunity&lt;/strong&gt; has profoundly excited me to an extent that, I was even ready to deliberately flunk my exam (only to appear again next year - 2023). Before this, I had half-heartedly accepted &amp;amp; planned to delay my research pursuit for 5-7 years to comply with the rules of govt. (min. time one should spend in the service to obtain a study leave). But, this discovery of &lt;strong&gt;opportunity&lt;/strong&gt; has &lt;strong&gt;rekindled&lt;/strong&gt; my spirit to pursue research without having to delay it any further. &lt;br&gt;
Prior to this discovery, my actual plan was to appear in UPSC-CSE (for IAS/IFS), finish my M.A. Economics at IGNOU so that I can appear for Indian Economic Services as a backup option.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now naturally, it might occur to you, if I'm so interested in research, with so many opportunities out there, be it at Google/Microsoft/Amazon Research labs, many other MNCs to work on Electronic Commerce/Algos/Networks etc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why don't I pursue research single-mindedly and become a Research Scientist/Professor ?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Jun'2019, I have made a steadfast decision to work for the state (govt.) as an organisation, in an administrative position, be it either in Administrative/Foreign Services, and pursue research as a &lt;strong&gt;habit&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;not as a hobby&lt;/strong&gt;; but &lt;strong&gt;with dedication&lt;/strong&gt;). Also, the fact that I find it very hard &amp;amp; contrasting to my personality, to dedicate myself to one particular area/subject for an extended period of time (&amp;gt;15+ yrs), has completely ruled out the option for me to even think of becoming a full-time professor. That's why, to work for the state in an administrative capacity &amp;amp; also to retain the felixibility in my breadth of interests - Maths, Theoretical CS &amp;amp; Economics etc., I have chosen this particular path - Civil Services + Research (as a habit).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="4-why-a-phd"&gt;4. Why a PhD ?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I have established already before, I made a steadfast decision to become part of either Administrative/Foreign service. But that doesn't mean I have to forgo my interest for research in theory, it was only a compromise (half-heartedly done) I had accepted for the decisions I took. I chose to delay my pursuit of PhD for 5-7 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="41-theoretical-economics-succcurlyeq-theoretical-cs"&gt;4.1 Theoretical Economics $\succcurlyeq$ Theoretical CS&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After spending some time working on projects till Jun'2019 in resolving the dilemma of my future pursuit between Theory &amp;amp; Applied aspects of Machine Learning (for more details check &lt;a href="https://jeanbourgain8.github.io/posts/Blogsite/2023-02-23-17%3A38%3A35/"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;), I have realised that my inclination was more towards Theory. Since then, I've been exploring (briefly) theory in different areas apart from Machine Learning within the Computer Science (Algorithmic Game Theory, Approximation Algos, Graph Theory &amp;amp; Combinatorics etc.), keeping myself updated with the new materials, directions and trends. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt; [Click to Expand] &lt;strong&gt;Some professors I follow in Computer Science&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Prahlad Harsha &amp;amp; Others. at TIFR, Siddharth Barman (Fair Division) at IISC &amp;amp; groups working at Google &amp;amp; Microsoft Research in India, U.Penn (Sampath Kannan), UW (Anna Karlin, Sebastien Bubeck, Yin-Tat-Lee etc.), UCSD (Shachar Lovett, Daniel Kane etc.), UIUC (Sariel Har-Peled, Jugal Garg, Ruta Mehta etc.), Princeton (Matt Weinberg etc.), Harvard (Madhusudhan etc.), CMU (Pradeep Ravikumar, Venkatesh Guruswami etc.) and many other groups at MIT (Constantinos Daskalakis etc.), UC Berkeley (Prasad Raghavendra, Moritz Hardt etc.), Columbia (Tim Roughgarden etc.), UW-Madison (Nowak, Suchi Chawla moved to UT-Austin etc.), Stanford (Andrea Montanari, etc.) &amp;amp; people at many others places - UWaterloo, Toronto, Oxford, ETHZ, EPFL etc.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt; 
Within India, I have found the research directions of Prof. Siddharth Barman at IISC interesting. So, I have made a note to work with him, if and when I plan to pursue my PhD in future. Now, in &lt;strong&gt;Sept'22&lt;/strong&gt;, when I found that similar works (in intersection of Maths, CS &amp;amp; Economics) are being done from Economics standpoint at &lt;strong&gt;ISI-Kolkata / Delhi&lt;/strong&gt;, right away I got fixated to their PhD opportunity. All of a sudden, I re-configured all my career plans and revived my PhD interest, which earlier was pushed back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this re-aligning of my interests with Economics as my primary focus from Theoretical CS, &lt;strong&gt;Prof. Soumyarup now at IIT - Kanpur, Prof. Sourav Roy at ISI-Kolkata, Prof. Debasis Mishra &amp;amp; Prof. Arunava Sen at ISI-Delhi have become the crown jewels to my this new world&lt;/strong&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among these, &lt;strong&gt;Prof. Soumyarup&lt;/strong&gt; being young and having just finished his PhD, I believe would be more actively connected with the current research trends and relateable, providing a sense of security especially in case of issues that may arise while pursuing PhD part-time (Ex: My improper timing in admission to the PhD program etc.). And, "&lt;ins&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the availability of the opportunity to pursue research remotely&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;" only makes this positive feeling even more concrete. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Altogether, PhD has always been part of my plan, it's just the matter of time (when) that's changed.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="5-how-will-phd-benefit"&gt;5. How will PhD benefit ?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I'll come to the cherry on top aspect of this entire PhD plan. While entering the UPSC-CSE journey, I wanted to become part of the Administrative Service (IAS) more than Foreign Service (IFS), but later after realising the demands of work beyond usual hours in the initials year of IAS, I was nudged to rethink about my choice, because some personal time to pursue either science or any other interests is non-negotiable to me, I feel this part of freedom is something very hard for me to forgo. Yet, I've affirmed to pursue IAS based on a personal compromise that I can pursue reasearch after 5-7 years by taking a study leave. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this discovery of a possibility to do a PhD part-time, has reinvigorated my spirit and changed all my plans. I changed my first preference to Foreign Services (IFS).  As far as I'm aware of, the initial years though demand responsibility, one will find enough time to pursue their interests while being in the service (IFS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cherry of this PhD Plan:&lt;/strong&gt; The change of my primary area of research from Theoretical CS to Theoretical Economics - &lt;strong&gt;Mechanism Design, Game Theory, Choices etc.,&lt;/strong&gt; all of these topics concern with the operations happening in strategic environments, which is exactly the core aspect of IFS job. This convergence of my research and professional interests is a blessing to me. Also, by obtaining a PhD , I will by default get to lead the Economics/Political Wing within the Foreign Services Divisions. &lt;/p&gt;</description><guid>https://jeanbourgain8.github.io/posts/Blogsite/2023-03-08-11%3A19%3A59/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 08 Mar 2023 05:49:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
