&lt;p&gt;I'm Hasanth, I graduated from IIT-Kharagpur with a Bachelors in Instrumentation Engg. (Dept. of Electrical Engg.) in 2016 and worked as a Software Engineer - II for one year at Hewlett Packard Enterprise - R&amp;amp;D between 2016-17 (resigned). In &lt;strong&gt;June 2019&lt;/strong&gt;, I was supposed to join &lt;strong&gt;University at Buffalo / University of Texas at Dallas (with scholarship) for my Masters in CS&lt;/strong&gt;, but due to some personal reasons I've dropped my plan and been preparing and appeared for UPSC-Civil Services Exam (CSE), with &lt;strong&gt;Maths as my optional&lt;/strong&gt; subject (&lt;a href="https://byjus.com/free-ias-prep/ias-mathematics-syllabus/"&gt;Syllabus&lt;/a&gt; includes B.Sc/M.Sc level subjects - &lt;strong&gt;Real Analysis, Algebra, ODEs &amp;amp; PDEs, Mathematical Physics - Fluid Dynamics, Linear Programming etc.&lt;/strong&gt;). &lt;br&gt;
Last year in &lt;strong&gt;Sept'22,&lt;/strong&gt; I gave my UPSC-Mains (Stage-II) exam after clearing the Prelims but unfortunately couldn't make it to the final list. &lt;br&gt;
Prior to this, I was interested in Theoretical CS with an inclination towards Economics, especially I was looking forward to working with Siddharth Barman (Fair Division etc.) at IISC down the line in future. After changing the plan to pursue UPSC, I made a decision to delay my PhD pursuit for 5-7 years after joining the service (which the govt. allows).&lt;br&gt;
But it was only in the last &lt;strong&gt;Oct'22&lt;/strong&gt;, I came across similar lines of research being done by &lt;strong&gt;You &amp;amp; Prof. Sourav Roy at ISI-Kolkata,  Prof. Debasis Mishra &amp;amp; Prof. Arunava Sen at ISI-Delhi etc.,&lt;/strong&gt; but from an Economics standpoint. In my search, &lt;strong&gt;I've also found that there exists an opportunity of pursuing a part-time PhD at ISI-Kolkata/Delhi &amp;amp; IITs - Kanpur, Delhi etc.,&lt;/strong&gt; which has got me very excited and made me revive my plan to pursue PhD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this regard, while continuing my preparation for UPSC-CSE to appear in 2023 (&lt;strong&gt;Prelims - May'23, Mains - Sept'23&lt;/strong&gt;), I've also started to pick up the basics of Economics from &lt;strong&gt;Oct'22&lt;/strong&gt; with the help of M.A. Economics at IGNOU (as I could get a M.A. degree remotely) and gave my 1st year exams in &lt;strong&gt;Dec'22-Jan'23&lt;/strong&gt;. But UPSC-CSE exam being extremely demanding in memory and time, I'm unable to complete the foundations required well within the time to appear for ISI-JRF(QE) exam being held in &lt;strong&gt;May'23&lt;/strong&gt;, especially reading Macro, Econometrics etc., appears more than my interests for now due my time being constrained. UPSC-Prelims is also being conducted in the same month as ISI-JRF (QE). As &lt;strong&gt;I'm aiming to secure a top rank in the final list without a compromise&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;I have decided to go back on ISI-JRF (QE) searching for alternatives which would allow me to take an admission in a part-time PhD program starting from Sept'23,&lt;/strong&gt; as soon as I finish with my UPSC-CSE(Mains) exam. &lt;br&gt;
By this, I will also get more than enough time to concretely build my foundations in Economic Theory. &lt;strong&gt;Above all, this would provide me enough time to read some papers and also pick up the trending research directions in the subjects - Mechanism Design, Game Theory, Choice &amp;amp; Decision Theory etc.&lt;/strong&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How will a part-time PhD benefit me, as I will be joining Civil Services ?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I will be choosing &lt;strong&gt;Indian Foreign Service&lt;/strong&gt; as my first cadre preference, where working in strategic environments happens to be the core aspect of the job. Even though the work may not be directly related to the research work I wish to do in (&lt;strong&gt;Mechanism Design, Game Theory,  Choice, Decision Theory etc.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;primarily&lt;/strong&gt;, if possible some other areas in Maths &amp;amp; TCS as well), it would provide enough on ground insights which can be aligned with above research topics. Also, a PhD work relating to such strategic analysis would make me a front runner in leading either the Economics/Political Wings within the Indian Foreign Service. &lt;strong&gt;By pursuing part-time while being in the service, I shall be secure and not have to worry about career &amp;amp; family etc. much, and can pursue research whole-heartedly with dedication.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As I will be joining the service (IFS) in Aug'24, I would only seek assistance or fellowship for the period Sept'23 to Aug'24, after that other than access to journals, travel grants and book-purchases, I won't be needing any kind of monetary assistance for my part-time PhD pursuit.&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, to conclude, I've always been a theory enthusiast starting from my Bachelors (when working for my thesis identifying &lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hmHOy27Xk3FgPk-aof9BHi59bLE3XmL4/view"&gt;mistakes&lt;/a&gt; in the algorithm of an IEEE-TPAMI &lt;a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6891337"&gt;Paper&lt;/a&gt; -  A&lt;em&gt; rating ML Theory Journal in 2015-16 (now NeurIPS)), till today in the intersection of &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Maths, Theoretical CS &amp;amp; Economics etc.&lt;/em&gt;* areas, pursuing a PhD was always part of my plan, it was only the matter of time (when) that has changed.&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid>https://jeanbourgain8.github.io/posts/Blogsite/2023-03-08-14%3A15%3A54/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 08 Mar 2023 08:45:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
