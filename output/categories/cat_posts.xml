&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="introduction-to-a-possibility"&gt;Introduction to a Possibility ?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sir, to my fortune I have found a great &lt;strong&gt;possibility&lt;/strong&gt; in &lt;strong&gt;Sept'2022&lt;/strong&gt;, which was the same month in which I gave my UPSC-CSE (Mains) Exam. The &lt;strong&gt;possibility&lt;/strong&gt; has profoundly excited me to an extent where I almost got ready to deliberately flunk the exam (only to appear in next year - 2023). Till then, I have half-heartedly accepted &amp;amp; planned to delay my research pursuit for 5-7 years to comply with the rules of govt. (min. time one should spend to obtain a study leave), but this discovery of a &lt;strong&gt;possibility&lt;/strong&gt; has &lt;strong&gt;rekindled&lt;/strong&gt; my spirit to pursue research without having to delay it any further. Prior to this, my actual plan was to appear in UPSC-CSE (IAS &amp;amp; IFS), finish my M.A. Economics at IGNOU so that I can appear for Indian Economic Services as a backup option. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturally, it might occur to you when I'm so interested in research &lt;strong&gt;"Why not I pursue it single-mindedly and become a Research Scientist/Professor ? "&lt;/strong&gt; with much wider opportunities existing today on Electronic Commerce/Networks etc., be it at Google/Microsoft/Amazon Research and many other MNCs. In 2019 (mid) I have made a steadfast decision to work for the state(govt.) as an organisation in an administrative position be it either in Administrative/Foreign Services and pursue research as a &lt;strong&gt;habit&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;not as a hobby&lt;/strong&gt;; but with dedication). Also, the fact that I find it very hard/challenging &amp;amp; contrasting to my personality to dedicate myself to one particular area/subject for an extended period of time (&amp;gt;10-15 yrs) has ruled out the choice/possibility of even thinking to become a full-time professor. That's why, to work for the state in an administrative capacity &amp;amp; also to retain independence in my breadth of interests - Maths, Theoretical CS &amp;amp; Economics etc., I have chosen this path.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="now-what-is-this-possibility"&gt;Now, What is this Possibility ?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have observed that ISI-Delhi provides an opportunity though not recommended yet it is open to consider a possibility for one to pursue their PhD remotely (not as a full-time). In my enquiry, I have come to know that there are people who are pursuing/have pursued research part-time (Ex: Leena Kumar etc.). Now, this option has come to me as a blessing. I do not have to wait/delay my plan of pursuing research further for 5-7 years more. &lt;br&gt;
Sir, In 2019(mid) after spending some time on resolving the dilemma of my interest between Theory &amp;amp; Applied aspects of Machine Learning, I have realised that my inclincation was more towards Theory. Since then, starting with theoretical aspects of machine learning I've been exploring (briefly) theory in different areas within the computer science (Algorithmic Game Theory, Approximation Algos, Graph Theory &amp;amp; Combinatorics etc.) and also been looking at the directions of works by theorists like Prof. Prahlad Harsha &amp;amp; others at TIFR etc., Prof. Siddharth Barman (Fair Division) &amp;amp; groups at Google &amp;amp; Microsoft Research in India, U.Penn (Sampath Kannan), UIUC (Jugal Garg, Ruta Mehta etc. - strong working group in Game Theory), Princeton (Matt Weinberg etc.) and other groups at MIT, Stanford etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only recently, after re-aligning my interests with Economics as primary focus from Theoretical CS, &lt;strong&gt;I have found ISI-Delhi with You &amp;amp; Prof. Arunava Sen as crown jewels to my world&lt;/strong&gt;. Adding to this, "&lt;ins&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the possibility of pursuing research remotely&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;" has only made the feeling even more concrete. In this regard, from Oct'22 I have started to pickup the basics of the subjects with the help of M.A. Economics course at IGNOU. I felt that it was the best option, simultaneously I could also earn a degree. Also, in my wildest dreams if anything goes wrong with the UPSC-CSE, I can appear for Indian Economic Services (M.A. Economics Compulsory) as a backup with the help of it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="now-what-is-the-problem"&gt;Now, What is the Problem ?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sir, although the ISI-JRF (QE) exam primarily focuses on foundational depth with some deducable patterns in the questions asked - Utility Maximization, Choice, Econometrics Basics, Time Series Basics, Growth Models &amp;amp; Nash Equilibrium &amp;amp; Sub-Perfect (some years they were missed). I came across some instances where the terminologies which are not quite common at the first instance (Ex: $2^{nd}$ Question's Perfect Labour Mobility in QEB, 2018 etc.) appear in the exam. 
If not for both ISI-JRF, IGNOU exams, I would have strictly confined myself to Microeconomic Theory and would have tried to cover as much material as possible on Theory of Choice, Game Theory, Mechanism Design &amp;amp; Auction Theory + Mathematical Programming (for Graphs for Networks &amp;amp; Linear Programming). Since, the exam is a competitive one and people who have been studying these subjects for almost 5 years (B.A + M.A) appear for the exam, I feel that I will need some extra time to cover the above topics broadly and concretely and also fill my gaps of knowledge in Econometrics &amp;amp; Macroeconomic Theory. UPSC-CSE being primarily a memory-based exam and me trying to secure a top-rank in the exam, it is requiring a major portion of my day-time along with its Mathematics Syllabus (almost equivalent to M.Sc Level). If it is not for Mathematics &amp;amp; it's vast syllabus (but fetches more marks), I think UPSC-CSE would have been much easier to be done away with.
All of the exams happening around the same time, it has become quite difficult for me to optimally allocate my attention &amp;amp; memory in order to obtain best results in all, where all of them being competitive. To my luck/bad-luck my 2nd year M.A. Economics exams of IGNOU are clashing with Indian Economic Services exam dates, preparation for these two has been demanding a lot of my memory space, both of them being verbose. So, for their sheer size in material and also clashing of dates I have decided not to appear for Indian Economic Services Exam this year &amp;amp; also give my 2nd year M.A. Economics exams in Dec'2023. With this only UPSC-CSE &amp;amp; ISI-JRF (QE) exams remain, yet both the exams also being in May'2023 and demands of the subjects are being quite contrasting, although QEA of ISI-JRF (QE) requires Probability &amp;amp; Statistics, Optimization etc., UPSC-CSE (Maths) has contrasting requirements with primary focus going towards ODEs, PDEs, Mathematical Physics, Group Theory, Real Analysis etc., 
All in All, despite cutting down the number of exams, both of them being enourmous in size demands, it has become quite difficult for me to manage in order to produce the best results in both. To address these problems I have found a solution but I would like to check with them and verify before I can proceed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="what-to-do"&gt;What to Do ?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Instead of appearing for the exam in May'23 and joining the campus in Aug'23, Can I instead seek admissoin starting from Sept'23 ?&lt;/strong&gt; If I'm ready to take any kind of examination which the admission board demands from me - written/interview etc.
   &lt;strong&gt;Solution:&lt;/strong&gt; By doing this I can provide maximum attention to UPSC-CSE untill I finsh off the exams in Sept'23. Also, this would provide me more than enough time for me to concretely establish my foundation strongly in Micro Theory - Choice &amp;amp; Welfare, Game Theory, Mechanism Design &amp;amp; Auctions, Network Theory I will also try to extend my knowledge after initially covering your notes at first  in these topics. Also, I shall fill my gaps in the knowledge of Econometrics &amp;amp; Macro Theory by that time much more beyond the requirements of the ISI-JRF Exam. Once, I get done away with UPSC-CSE properly by securing a top-rank, I will whole-heartedly be able to dedicate myself to research.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is ISI-JRF (QE) exam the only way to join the PhD program with a fellowship ? Can I instead start my PhD program on your SERB grant for the period Sept'23 - Jul'24 and clear the exam in 2024 for JRF ?&lt;/strong&gt; So that, in future despite of getting into Civil Services, I will be eligible for grants to conferences, book-purchasing etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id="extras"&gt;Extras&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id="how-did-i-zero-in-on-isi-delhi"&gt;How did I zero in on ISI-Delhi ?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started my research pursuit with &lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1baLe5P9N5wIfxbIhuJDW9uw_jOTpaQQU/view?usp=sharing"&gt;Bio-Medical Devices &amp;amp; Imaging&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IwRRM0X6Xsn-6FphBChUmscy894OCHYl/view"&gt;Instrumentation&lt;/a&gt; and have walked a long path experimenting in different areas - &lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LS3Y6dzPuQ-YZN2ZHMHlZPWwNeGkSEyo/view?usp=sharing"&gt;Machine Learning&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://github.com/anhttran/3dmm_cnn"&gt;Applied&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1y33JUi8W0MT1X8cHpywhF-WbSSGmsKKO?usp=sharing"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hmHOy27Xk3FgPk-aof9BHi59bLE3XmL4/view"&gt;Theory&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.00523v1.pdf"&gt;3D&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://flame.is.tue.mpg.de/"&gt;Face&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://smpl-x.is.tue.mpg.de/"&gt;Body&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://grail.cs.washington.edu/projects/AudioToObama/"&gt;Reconstruction&lt;/a&gt;, SLAM (typically called as &lt;a href="https://grail.cs.washington.edu/projects/personnerf/"&gt;NERFs&lt;/a&gt; recently) etc. where some happened to be co-incidental (includes job at HPE) with the trends and others well thought ones (exploring Theory). For this, I do believe that my graduation course is also partly responsible where unlike other core branches such as EE, ECE, CS etc., Instrumentation Engg. curriculum at IIT-KGP happens to be a mix of all three with little specific to Instrumentation, limited by its extent of applications. It was only in 2019 (mid) I have concretely realized that my interests primarily lie in the intersection of Maths, Theoretical CS &amp;amp; Economics subjects, and resolved to pursue research for the coming next 10-15 years in these fields. I was supposed to join in one of Masters CS programs starting from June'2019 but for some specific reasons, and also having realized by then already that I like Theory a lot more than the Applied aspects of research, I have dropped my masters plan abroad (avoiding to spend any sums) and chose the path of Civil Services with a plan to do a PhD down the line after 5-7 years being in the service (which is allowed complying with the rules). Till then, I actually planned to pursue research independently more as a habit and enter into a PhD program in future with problems identified well beforehand to work upon.&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid>https://jeanbourgain8.github.io/posts/Blogsite/2023-03-03-10%3A15%3A45/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 04:45:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Past, Present &amp; Future - II</title><link>https://jeanbourgain8.github.io/posts/Blogsite/2023-03-01-16%3A30%3A39/</link><dc:creator>Hasanth</dc:creator><description>&lt;h5&gt;Table of Contents&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h2 id="2012-2016"&gt;2012 - 2016&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I graduated with a Bachelors Degree in Instrumentation Engineering (EE) from IIT Kharagpur in 2016. During my bachelors, I started with working on Biomedical Devices, Instrumentation in 2nd year (summer) planning to specalise in Bio-Medical Instrumentation. 
Later, in my third year I associated with PhDs working on Bio-Medical Imaging &amp;amp; Machine Learning (Applied) at School of Medical Sciences (SMST) - IIT KGP. In 3rd year summer (2015), I did an internship at Reliance Industries Ltd., Surat. There, in recognition to my work, I was specially &lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IwRRM0X6Xsn-6FphBChUmscy894OCHYl/view?usp=share_link"&gt;felicitated&lt;/a&gt; by VP-Engineering for solving a long-standing problem in their Rubber Manufacturing Plant. For this, I was also awarded a Pre-Placement Offer (I didn't take up the offer). 
In my final year, I got placed in Hewlett - Packard Enterprise - HPE (they said it was R&amp;amp;D while recruting, buggers ended up making me do software).&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Variational Bayesian Matrix Factorization for Bounded Support Data&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="https://jeanbourgain8.github.io/posts/Blogsite/2023-02-23-17%3A38%3A35/#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, is the title of the &lt;a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=34"&gt;IEEE-TPAMI&lt;/a&gt; paper which I took up for my graduation thesis project. I found errors in their core algorithm equations and informed about the &lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hmHOy27Xk3FgPk-aof9BHi59bLE3XmL4/view?usp=share_link"&gt;corrections&lt;/a&gt; to them, which they had accepted but sadly, the corrections weren't significant enough to write a fresh paper. 😕&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Projects that I worked on during my Bachelors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Modelling the Transitions in Lung cancer cells and classification of different cells using Deep Belief Networks.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Modelling different stages of epigenomic cells and classifying them into 4 different transition stages with an accuracy of 97.5% and 89.9% respectively for binary and multi-class problems.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Conceptualized and designed a prototype of a product which is made by bringing all kinds of card tests in one compact machine to detect conditions of diseases (group project).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few courses I took during my bachelors which aligned with my then interests: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Machine Learning, &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Computational Methods &amp;amp; Algorithms in Signal Processing, &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Probability &amp;amp; Statistics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Digital Image Processing, &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Information Theory, &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Computer Networks etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During my bachelors, I have been part of various extra-academic activities. I was part of a Gold-Winning Ad-Design Team, Product Design Team, Chemical Innovation Team &amp;amp; Hardware Modelling Teams. I also played some hockey briefly during my 2nd year. 
I have also guided some of juniors for an Open-IIT Product Design Competition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="2016-2019"&gt;2016 - 2019&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I joined HPE in &lt;strong&gt;Aug'16&lt;/strong&gt;, there I worked on Spring Boot Frameworks, Hibernate etc. Initially, I did some (junk) Splunk setup &amp;amp;  Automation works. Later, some UI bugs they made me fix and by the end I was mostly doing some Backend stuff (on whole, I got some full stack experience) for a Network Security Product. I didn't find the work much interesting, I realized that I would be better at doing R&amp;amp;D works than software. 
So, I resigned in &lt;strong&gt;Sept'17&lt;/strong&gt;, hoping to apply for Masters in 2018 (starting MS in 2019), after spending some time on my own to identify my interests precisely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this period, from graduation till my resignition &lt;strong&gt;(Aug'16 - Aug'17&lt;/strong&gt;), I have gained some interest in &lt;a href="https://www.irakemelmacher.com/"&gt;Prof. Ira Kemelmacher's&lt;/a&gt; working areas - 3D Facial Reconstruction, SLAM (partly) etc. Also, back then, there wasn't much buzz about Deep Learning etc. yet, not at least in India. Though Yann's, Hinton's &amp;amp; Fei-Fei's models were just starting to make some noise, they didn't get much attention (that's what I think). The pre-doc programs at MSR-India, Google etc., were also not so well known back then. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I resigned my job at HPE, but had to spend some time on the growing heap of works then (ML &amp;amp; DL buzz just got picked up) to decide upon my interests between ML Theory &amp;amp; ML Applied. 
For my thesis, I worked on Machine Learning Theory, but I also started gaining some interest in 3D Facial Reconstruction, SLAM etc. So, to check with the dilemma, I decided to apply for Research Assistanship at IISC - CSA. At that time, having some of prior experience a little statistically inclined, I found Ambedkar Dukkipati for (ML-Theory) &amp;amp; VAL Lab in CDS (for ML in images - Computer Vision etc.) as professors suitable to work with. I applied for VAL Lab and was asked to attend an interview for an RA Position. I did attend, but came back in the middle of the interview after having some argument with them about their notations on Regression's Cost Minimization Function and an equation related to the function which they asked me to derive. Also, I realised that they wanted me more for the implementation parts of the project than for the theoretical understanding of workings of Deep Learning on images. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I returned to home, used up the last amounts of my salary left in my bank account to &lt;a href="https://jeanbourgain8.github.io/posts/Substack/Product/Code/System%20Maintenance/deep-learning-setup/"&gt;build a PC&lt;/a&gt;. It costed me around 1 Lakh, I assembled the PC myself, where I bought the parts in all kinds of sales. By that time, AWS &amp;amp; Google Cloud - GPUs &amp;amp; TPUs services weren't much known, I think they didn't even get started. So, that's why I had to burn so much of my money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, between &lt;strong&gt;Oct'17 - Jul'18&lt;/strong&gt;. I built my PC, installing all softwares &amp;amp; their patches, version matchings (all of this took loads of time, which one might easily misjudge as too much since it is has become very easy now to create a setup ready for ML &amp;amp; DL works). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;strong&gt;May'18&lt;/strong&gt;,  I've participated in two Ideathons (Ideas' Hackathons) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hackerearth.com/challenges/hackathon/rupay-contactless-ideathon/"&gt;Rupay Contactless Ideathon&lt;/a&gt; (by NPCI, related to UPI Payments)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hackerearth.com/challenges/hackathon/pg-global-innovation-challenge/"&gt;P&amp;amp;G's Global Innovation Challenge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Rupay's Hackathon, I was one (solo) of the &lt;strong&gt;Top 10 finalists&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup id="fnref:5"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="https://jeanbourgain8.github.io/posts/Blogsite/2023-02-23-17%3A38%3A35/#fn:5"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; among 1.2K teams (2 allowed per each team). 
In P&amp;amp;G's hackathon, two of my solutions were shortlisted in &lt;strong&gt;Top 50&lt;/strong&gt; ideas, this too similarly around 1.2K teams took part (4 allowed per each team). I resigned and didn't proceed further to the next levels of hackathon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, I started by first picking up &amp;amp; working on concepts of 3D Facial Reconstruction. 
List below, are some of research groups whose works I have tried to build upon my product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hao-li.com/Hao_Li/Hao_Li_-_publications.html"&gt;Hao Li&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX8AIRsFmTA"&gt;Demo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id="fnref:6"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="https://jeanbourgain8.github.io/posts/Blogsite/2023-02-23-17%3A38%3A35/#fn:6"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; , &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dERjpAaoNjk"&gt;Demo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id="fnref:7"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="https://jeanbourgain8.github.io/posts/Blogsite/2023-02-23-17%3A38%3A35/#fn:7"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.irakemelmacher.com/research"&gt;Ira Kemelmacher&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id="fnref:8"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="https://jeanbourgain8.github.io/posts/Blogsite/2023-02-23-17%3A38%3A35/#fn:8"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.patrikhuber.ch/"&gt;Patrik Huber's&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id="fnref:9"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="https://jeanbourgain8.github.io/posts/Blogsite/2023-02-23-17%3A38%3A35/#fn:9"&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; was the most easily accessible work of all at that time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://ps.is.mpg.de/"&gt;Max Planck Institute(MPI)'s&lt;/a&gt; models for face&lt;sup id="fnref:10"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="https://jeanbourgain8.github.io/posts/Blogsite/2023-02-23-17%3A38%3A35/#fn:10"&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;amp; body&lt;sup id="fnref:11"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="https://jeanbourgain8.github.io/posts/Blogsite/2023-02-23-17%3A38%3A35/#fn:11"&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; - Amazon purchased the venture with the name &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_Labs"&gt;Body Labs&lt;/a&gt; which was being developed by these researchers at MPI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.yisongyue.com/research.php"&gt;Yisong Yue's&lt;/a&gt; group integrated the component of voices/lip movement to faces - &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zL7qejW9fE"&gt;Demo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id="fnref:12"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="https://jeanbourgain8.github.io/posts/Blogsite/2023-02-23-17%3A38%3A35/#fn:12"&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://alexlattas.com/"&gt;Imperical College London's Group - ICL's&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id="fnref:13"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="https://jeanbourgain8.github.io/posts/Blogsite/2023-02-23-17%3A38%3A35/#fn:13"&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; work was the most promising way for 3D Realistic Face Avatars. That's why Facebook bought their work right away. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have tried to access and replicate these works in order to come up with a product that would take in something like a 2D frontal face input and convert it to 3D avatar. I've gone through entire code bases and debugged their works, even found some errors in ICL's works and made them aware, to which they didn't care much to respond 😅.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From &lt;strong&gt;Jul'18 - Aug'18&lt;/strong&gt;, I have prepared for GRE and gave the exams. I got 169/170 in Maths, but 151/170 in English (320 overall). I knew that english would be my pain point at that time for GRE. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting back to 3D faces, somewhere in and around &lt;strong&gt;Sept'18&lt;/strong&gt;, Apple came up with its Augmented Reality (AR) Tech. by adding a depth front camera to its IPhone. It was with this, all my 3D Face Reconstruction dream world came down crashing to an end. Till then, I was trying to build something which would take in a 2D image and spit out a 3D caricature, with an addition of some voice regarding developments as well (possibly). But, the avatars which Apple came up with were so cool that how much ever I may try to come with a system that's efficient in 2D frontal image to 3D face conversion, it can never be as cool as Apple's due to its depth camera addition to the mobiles. All of a sudden, the friendly 3D reconstruction tech became so affordable, especially for faces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;strong&gt;Nov'18&lt;/strong&gt;, I was already late by then, I started collecting recommendation letters from professors &amp;amp; some of my mentors from my resigned workplace. I had to go to IIT to get recommendation letters from my bachelors advisor. Amidst this mess, when I went to Delhi to visit some of my friends who were preparing for UPSC already by then for more than over a year, a family issue arised which required my utmost attention. Majority of my time between &lt;strong&gt;Nov'18 - Jan'19 (mid)&lt;/strong&gt; went away in roaming around hospitals. During this time, simultaneously I finished my applications for Masters Programs in Computer Science. I applied to 4 colleges and got accepts from &lt;strong&gt;University at Buffalo - SUNY&lt;/strong&gt;,  &lt;strong&gt;University of Texas - Dallas (with scholarship).&lt;/strong&gt; But, I wasn't quite satisfied mith my accepts. I knew that my language skills have improved a little but I failed to recognise that they weren't good enough to write a gramatically correct &amp;amp; an engaging SOP. I must have taken some assistance, Sigh! 😕&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;strong&gt;Feb'19&lt;/strong&gt;, things became normal at home and running around hospitals has come to an end. The time spent at hospitals changed my outlook towards life drastically. I witnessed hospitals charging unscrupulous rates and treating with sub-standard equipment, especially those people, whose expenses are paid from the govt. health insurance policies - poor, employees etc. All such issues have pushed me to give a shot at UPSC, before I leave for Masters in &lt;strong&gt;Aug'19&lt;/strong&gt;. 
So, in &lt;strong&gt;Feb'19&lt;/strong&gt; without any knowledge, by just looking at some blogposts (Anudeep's etc.), I decided to pursue UPSC, picked up a few books online, shifted myself to Hyderabad to a secluded place and started preparing. As I wasn't much happy with the accepts and also having realised that my interests were more inclined towards theory, I dropped my plan of pursuing Masters (MS)  abroad (saving myself from hefty expenses). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, I have been in the UPSC journey and simultaneously charting out my career towards  becoming an independent researcher by habit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="book-review"&gt;Book Review&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An informed reader would already know that the author's disposition is quite unconventional in this book. He tries to dismantle the usual emphasis laid on virtues, as to him, they appear too distant from reality &amp;amp; handicapped when it comes to getting things done. He treats both virtues &amp;amp; vices with equanimity. His core agenda appears to be this - "&lt;strong&gt;doing whatever it takes to retain the kingship&lt;/strong&gt;". Depending on the environment, situations &amp;amp; resources available, he puts forward necessary strategies which are to be adopted. On whole, it is a guide which addresses all significant stages one comes across in the cycle of kingship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I consider this as an insightful read. I shall not think twice if I wish to read it again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="book-review"&gt;Book Review&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've finished reading the book. On whole, it's a one time read. If there is anything that I'll take home from the book, that will be its unconventional sentences, quite different from what I'm aware of. Finally, I've read one of &lt;strong&gt;Agatha Christie's&lt;/strong&gt;! This will be my second detective-fiction/mystery author reading, my first one is &lt;strong&gt;Earl Stanley Gardener&lt;/strong&gt; (Perry Mason).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the book, I did observe emphasis placed on parallel, case-based thinking. It gave me a positive feeling. I've been trying to get back to this way of thinking for some days, after having taken a good long break from it. I'm eagerly looking forward to compare Agatha's protaganist &lt;strong&gt;Hercule Poirot&lt;/strong&gt; with Stanley's &lt;strong&gt;Perry Mason&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concluding, it's a breezy read and won't take much time to finish. Hold your expectations moderate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;OS - Ubuntu 16.04&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Graphics - Nvidia Optimus (GTX1070 + IntelHD)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="disabling-nouveau-driver"&gt;Disabling "nouveau" driver&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Install one editor which you like the most&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;sudo apt-get install vim
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before installing the drivers into your hybrid system, first we need to disable nouveau (default display driver comes with linux) because it lies above all in permissions. Press 'CTRL+Alt+F1' to open the terminal, enter your username, password credentials and enter &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;sudo vim /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, add the following lines at the end of the file (Save &amp;amp; Exit)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;blacklist nouveau
blacklist lbm-nouveau
options nouveau &lt;span class="nv"&gt;modeset&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;alias&lt;/span&gt; nouveau off
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;alias&lt;/span&gt; lbm-nouveau off
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, get back to the terminal and enter the following and update the kernel and then reboot&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; options nouveau &lt;span class="nv"&gt;modeset&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; sudo tee -a /etc/modprobe.d/nouveau-kms.conf
sudo update-initramfs -u
sudo reboot
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id="working-setup-using-bumblebee-primus-for-intelnvidia-gpu"&gt;Working setup using bumblebee &amp;amp; primus for Intel+Nvidia GPU&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, using primus we can switch between the graphics (Nvidia &amp;amp; Intel). We take the help of bumblebee to make this smooth and a GUI indicator to make the transistions simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add the following repositories&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;sudo apt-add-repository ppa:graphics-drivers
sudo apt-add-repository ppa:bumblebee/testing
sudo apt-add-repository ppa:nilarimogard/webupd8
sudo apt-get update
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go to Settings &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Software &amp;amp; Updates &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Additional Drivers
Select Nvidia-378 driver (because it is stable and it worked for me) and click on Apply then Restart the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Restarting, you can see the Nvidia-driver being selected as the display driver which previously was Xorg's nouveau. For further confirmation, you can check with the following command and the output must be something like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;nvidia-smi

&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;root@localhost release&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# nvidia-smi&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; Compute processes:                                               GPU Memory &lt;span class="p"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;.  &lt;span class="m"&gt;7336&lt;/span&gt;     ./align                                                 61MB  &lt;span class="p"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, either use command line or Synaptics Manager to install the requirements. For simplicity, I shall use Synaptic Manager to demonstrate
1. Enter bumblebee in the search dialog then you will be able to seea list - bumblebee, bumblebee-nvidia, primus. Select all the three and Mark up them for Installation and click Apply
2. After installing above three we check for bbswitch-dkms in search dialog box. This can be seen as already installed (if not then do install it)
Get back to the terminal and take the help of prime to select Intel Graphics as primary&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;sudo prime-select intel
sudo reboot
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, enter prime-indicator(/plus) in search and mark up for installation. Restart your system.
Inorder to make the bumblebee and bbswitch to take care of your system and use latest nvidia driver which has been just installed, go to the following file and edit&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;sudo vim /etc/bumblebee/bumblebee.conf
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update the following contents&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;Driver&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; should be changed to
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;Driver&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;nvidia
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In [driver-nvidia] section replace all nvidia-current terms to nvidia-378 (If you have installed 378 or else replace it with the driver number whichever has been installed) and also in the same section replace&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;PMMethod&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;auto
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;PMMethod&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;bbswitch
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now restart&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;sudo reboot
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are done with our Nvidia driver installation and we also can switch between Intel and Nvidia Graphics which will help with saving the battery&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="installation-of-cuda-80-and-verification"&gt;Installation of CUDA-8.0 and verification&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, switch to Nvidia Graphics and download the run file. In my case, I have downloaded &lt;code&gt;cuda_8.0.61_375.26_linux.run&lt;/code&gt; file because, previous ones need a below 4.9 gcc compiler but when it comes to 16.04 by defualt it installs gcc-5.0. The installation of Caffe requires a gcc-5 compiler to work (portbuf). After downloading, go to the specific folder and then enter&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;chmod &lt;span class="m"&gt;755&lt;/span&gt; cuda_8.0.61_375.26_linux.run
sudo ./cuda_8.0.61_375.26_linux.run
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enter 'no' when asked to install Nvidia driver and rest all can be entered as "yes".
Don't worry if it shows something like this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;===========&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;Summary&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="o"&gt;===========&lt;/span&gt;

Driver: Not Selected

Toolkit: Installed &lt;span class="k"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; /usr/local/cuda-8.0

Samples: Installed &lt;span class="k"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; /home/username, but missing recommended libraries

Please make sure that

- PATH includes /usr/local/cuda-8.0/bin

- LD_LIBRARY_PATH includes /usr/local/cuda-8.0/lib64, or, add /usr/local/cuda-8.0/lib64 to /etc/ld.so.conf and run ldconfig as root

To uninstall the CUDA Toolkit, run the uninstall script &lt;span class="k"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; /usr/local/cuda-8.0/bin

Please see CUDA_Installation_Guide_Linux.pdf &lt;span class="k"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; /usr/local/cuda-8.0/doc/pdf &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; detailed information on setting up CUDA.

***WARNING: Incomplete installation! This installation did not install the CUDA Driver. A driver of version at least &lt;span class="m"&gt;361&lt;/span&gt;.00 is required &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; CUDA &lt;span class="m"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;.0 functionality to work.
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now (Optional not required)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;sudo modprobe nvidia
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;sudo vim /etc/profile

and enter &lt;span class="k"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; the end

&lt;span class="nb"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;PATH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;/usr/local/cuda-8.0/bin:&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$PATH&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;LD_LIBRARY_PATH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;/usr/local/cuda-8.0/lib64:&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$LD_LIBRARY_PATH&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Save &amp;amp; Exit&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;sudo ldconfig
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The setup is complete for CUDA now it's time to verify this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;sudo apt-get install freeglut3-dev build-essential libx11-dev libxmu-dev libxi-dev  libglu1-mesa libglu1-mesa-dev libgl1-mesa-glx  
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go to the location where samples folder is installed by default it is installed at ~/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; into the samples directory
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; 1_Utilities/deviceQuery
sudo make
sudo ./deviceQuery
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should show something like this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;Device &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;: Quadro M1000M

     &amp;lt; Default &lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;multiple host threads can use with device simultaneously&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &amp;gt;

deviceQuery, CUDA &lt;span class="nv"&gt;Driver&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; CUDART, CUDA Driver &lt;span class="nv"&gt;Version&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;.0, CUDA Runtime &lt;span class="nv"&gt;Version&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;.5, &lt;span class="nv"&gt;NumDevs&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="nv"&gt;Device0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; Quadro M1000M
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;Result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; PASS
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, we conduct the bandwidth test which will also show PASS, something similar to above  and with this we confirm its installation. If it shows "fail" then there is some error in CUDA installation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; ..
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; bandwidthTest
sudo make
sudo ./bandwidthTest
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this, we are ready with our system to use CUDA and NVIDIA GPU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="installation-of-cudnn"&gt;Installation of CUDNN&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go to Nvidia's site and download cuDNN ( I myself used cuDNN 5.1) you will get almost 98MB file. Extract the contents and go to the extracted folder&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; /cuda
sudo cp -P include/cudnn.h /usr/include
sudo cp -P lib64/libcudnn* /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/
sudo chmod a+r /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libcudnn*
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id="installing-opencv32-just-enough-for-working-with-caffe"&gt;Installing OpenCV3.2 (just enough for working with caffe)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Ubuntu 16.04, install the dependencies first and then build the OpenCV 3.2 from source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;sudo apt-get install --assume-yes build-essential cmake git
sudo apt-get install --assume-yes pkg-config unzip ffmpeg qtbase5-dev python-dev python3-dev python-numpy python3-numpy
sudo apt-get install --assume-yes libopencv-dev libgtk-3-dev libdc1394-22 libdc1394-22-dev libjpeg-dev libpng12-dev libtiff5-dev libjasper-dev
sudo apt-get install --assume-yes libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libswscale-dev libxine2-dev libgstreamer0.10-dev libgstreamer-plugins-base0.10-dev
sudo apt-get install --assume-yes libv4l-dev libtbb-dev libfaac-dev libmp3lame-dev libopencore-amrnb-dev libopencore-amrwb-dev libtheora-dev
sudo apt-get install --assume-yes libvorbis-dev libxvidcore-dev v4l-utils python-vtk
sudo apt-get install --assume-yes liblapacke-dev libopenblas-dev checkinstall
sudo apt-get install --assume-yes libgdal-dev
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Download the latest source archive for OpenCV 3.2 from https://github.com/opencv/opencv/archive/3.2.0.zip&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter the unpacked directory. Execute&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;mkdir build
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; build/    
cmake -D &lt;span class="nv"&gt;CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;RELEASE -D &lt;span class="nv"&gt;CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;/usr/local -D &lt;span class="nv"&gt;FORCE_VTK&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;ON -D &lt;span class="nv"&gt;WITH_TBB&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;ON -D &lt;span class="nv"&gt;WITH_V4L&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;ON -D &lt;span class="nv"&gt;WITH_QT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;ON -D &lt;span class="nv"&gt;WITH_OPENGL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;ON -D &lt;span class="nv"&gt;WITH_CUBLAS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;ON -D &lt;span class="nv"&gt;CUDA_NVCC_FLAGS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"-D_FORCE_INLINES"&lt;/span&gt; -D &lt;span class="nv"&gt;WITH_GDAL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;ON -D &lt;span class="nv"&gt;WITH_XINE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;ON -D &lt;span class="nv"&gt;BUILD_EXAMPLES&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;ON ..
make -j &lt;span class="k"&gt;$(($(&lt;/span&gt;nproc&lt;span class="k"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To complete the installation execute the following&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;sudo make install
sudo /bin/bash -c &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'echo "/usr/local/lib" &amp;gt; /etc/ld.so.conf.d/opencv.conf'&lt;/span&gt;
sudo ldconfig
sudo apt-get update
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verify installation with&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;python
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; import cv2
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it doesn't work then there is some error with OpenCV3.2 installation. Now, we are done with our OpenCV3 installation, next we jump into Caffe installation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="installing-caffe-with-opencv3-gpu-cudacudnn"&gt;Installing Caffe with OpenCV3 &amp;amp; GPU (CUDA+cuDNN)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For pre-requisites we execute the following lines&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade

sudo apt-get install -y build-essential cmake git pkg-config
sudo apt-get install -y libprotobuf-dev libleveldb-dev libsnappy-dev libhdf5-serial-dev protobuf-compiler
sudo apt-get install -y libatlas-base-dev
sudo apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends libboost-all-dev
sudo apt-get install -y libgflags-dev libgoogle-glog-dev liblmdb-dev

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# (Python general)&lt;/span&gt;
sudo apt-get install -y python-pip

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# (Python 2.7 development files)&lt;/span&gt;
sudo apt-get install -y python-dev
sudo apt-get install -y python-numpy python-scipy
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clone the Caffe repo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; ~
git clone https://github.com/BVLC/caffe.git
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make changes in Makefile.config and Makefile and configure it to proceed with the Caffe installation smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; ~/caffe
cp Makefile.config.example Makefile.config
sudo vim Makefile.config
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make the following changes and configure the copied Makefile.config (by uncommenting and editing the following lines in the file)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;USE_CUDNN :&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
OPENCV_VERSION :&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;

Change
CUDA_DIR :&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; /usr/local/cuda
to
CUDA_DIR :&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; /usr/local/cuda-8.0

PYTHON_INCLUDE :&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; /usr/include/python2.7 /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/numpy/core/include
WITH_PYTHON_LAYER :&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
INCLUDE_DIRS :&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;PYTHON_INCLUDE&lt;span class="k"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; /usr/local/include /usr/include/hdf5/serial
LIBRARY_DIRS :&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;PYTHON_LIB&lt;span class="k"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; /usr/local/lib /usr/lib /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/hdf5/serial
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somtimes, the PYTHON_INCLUDE may differ in some systems check for the presence of numpy core files&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;PYTHON_INCLUDE :&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; /usr/include/python2.7 /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/numpy/core/include  
WITH_PYTHON_LAYER :&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;  
INCLUDE_DIRS :&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;PYTHON_INCLUDE&lt;span class="k"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; /usr/local/include /usr/include/hdf5/serial  
LIBRARY_DIRS :&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;PYTHON_LIB&lt;span class="k"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; /usr/local/lib /usr/lib /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/hdf5/serial
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, edit Makefile ( above we edited Makefile.config)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; ~/caffe
sudo vim Makefile

Change
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;NVCCFLAGS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt; -ccbin&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;CXX&lt;span class="k"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; -Xcompiler -fPIC &lt;span class="k"&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;COMMON_FLAGS&lt;span class="k"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
to
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;NVCCFLAGS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt; -D_FORCE_INLINES -ccbin&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;CXX&lt;span class="k"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; -Xcompiler -fPIC &lt;span class="k"&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;COMMON_FLAGS&lt;span class="k"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Install some python requirements with pip&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; ~/caffe/python
&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; req &lt;span class="k"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;cat requirements.txt&lt;span class="k"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt; sudo -H pip install &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$req&lt;/span&gt; --upgrade&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;done&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's time to check make and check caffe's installation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; ~/caffe
make all -j &lt;span class="k"&gt;$(($(&lt;/span&gt;nproc&lt;span class="k"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
make &lt;span class="nb"&gt;test&lt;/span&gt;
make runtest

make pycaffe
make distribute

sudo vim ~/.bashrc
add the follwing line to the file
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;PYTHONPATH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;~/caffe/python:&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$PYTHONPATH&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;source&lt;/span&gt; ~/.bashrc
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verify your installation with (for python2.7)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;python&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;caffe&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, Deep Learning setup all ready for running. Get Going!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Repairing (installation) Audio Drivers of Debian PC&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://jeanbourgain8.github.io/images/Audio%20Drivers%20Installation.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To support my freshly built PC, 4.11 kernel version for Realtek-ALC1220 was needed to support its audio. So, if you too are building your own new PC like me then this might help you as a  temporary fix. 
Uninstall your alsa-base and reinstall latest version it should work fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;sudo apt-get remove alsa-base
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now go to http://www.stchman.com/tools/alsa/alsa_setup.sh and download the script and then do&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;sudo ./alsa_setup.sh
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will reinstall the lastest driver in your system and reboots it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Precaution:&lt;/strong&gt;  If you are having a Hybrid Graphics (Intel + Nvidia) then it is suggested to modify alsa-base when you are on Intel HD Graphics. Because this driver supports primarily Intel HDA versions. If you try to install while you are on NVIDIA graphics it might cause many failures.&lt;/p&gt;
