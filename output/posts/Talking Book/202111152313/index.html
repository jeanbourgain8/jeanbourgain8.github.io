<h3 id="book-review">Book Review</h3>
<hr>
<p>As an avg. reader would already be aware that the author's disposition is unconventional in this book. </p>
<p>He tries to dismantle the usual emphasis laid on virtues, as to him, they appear too distant from reality &amp; handicapped when it comes to getting things done. He treats both virtues &amp; vices in equanimity, where the core ideology appears to be this - "doing whatever it takes to retain the kingship". He depending on the environments &amp; weights of different situations, resources, put forwards necessary strategies which are to be adopted. It is a compendium &amp; addresses all significant stages in the cycle of kingship.</p>
<p>I surely consider this as an insightful read &amp; whenever necessary I would never forget/think twice to get back to reading it again. </p>

<p><strong>Chapter 2 - Of Hereditary Princedoms</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Moreover, the very antiquity and continuance of his rule will efface the memories and causes which lead to innovation. For one change always leaves a dovetail into which another will fit.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Chapter 3 - Of Mixed Princedoms</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This again results naturally and necessarily from the circumstance that the Prince cannot avoid giving offence to his new subjects</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For however strong you may be in respect of your army, it is essential that in entering a new Province you should have the good will of its inhabitants</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the Prince, using the rebellion as a pretext, will not scruple to secure himself by punishing the guilty, bringing the suspected to trial, and otherwise strengthening his position in the points where it was weak</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He, therefore, who acquires such a State, if he mean to keep it, must see to two things; first, that the blood of the ancient line of Princes be destroyed; second, that no change be made in respect of laws or taxes; for in this way the newly acquired State speedily becomes incorporated with the hereditary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He can send them out and support them at little or no charge to himself, and the only persons to whom he gives offence are those whom he deprives of their fields and houses to bestow them on the new inhabitants</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And let it here be noted that men are either to be kindly treated, or utterly crushed, since they can revenge lighter injuries, but not graver.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wherefore the injury we do to a man should be of a sort to leave no fear of reprisals.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Chapter 5 - How Cities or Provinces Which Before Their Acquisition Have Lived Under Their Own Laws Are To Be Governed</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The memory of their former freedom will not let them rest; so that the safest course is either to destroy them, or to go and live in them.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Chapter 6 - Of New Princedoms Which a Prince Acquires With His Own Arms and by Merit</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The wise man should always follow the roads that have been trodden by the great, and imitate those who have most excelled, so that if he cannot reach their perfection, he may at least acquire something of its savour.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Chapter 7 - Of New Princedoms Acquired By the Aid of Others and By Good Fortune</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Whoever, therefore, on entering a new Princedom, judges it necessary to rid himself of enemies, to conciliate friends, to prevail by force or fraud, to make himself feared yet not hated by his subjects, respected and obeyed by his soldiers, to crush those who can or ought to injure him, to introduce changes in the old order of things, to be at once severe and affable, magnanimous and liberal, to do away with a mutinous army and create a new one, to maintain relations with Kings and Princes on such a footing that they must see it for their interest to aid him, and dangerous to offend, can find no brighter example than in the actions of this Prince.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And he deceives himself who believes that with the great, recent benefits cause old wrongs to be forgotten.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="14-november-2021">14 November 2021</h4>
<hr>
<p><strong>Chapter 8 - Of Those Who By Their Crimes Come to Be Princes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Injuries, therefore, should be inflicted all at once, that their ill savour being less lasting may the less offend; whereas, benefits should be conferred little by little, that so they may be more fully relished.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A Prince should so live with his subjects that no vicissitude of good or evil fortune shall oblige him to alter his behaviour</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a need to change come through adversity, it is then too late to resort to severity; while any leniency you may use will be thrown away, for it will be seen to be compulsory and gain you no thanks.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Chapter 9 - Of the Civil Princedom</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>He who is made Prince by the favour of the nobles, has greater difficulty to maintain himself than he who comes to the Princedom by aid of the people</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But he who reaches the Princedom by the popular support, finds himself alone, with none, or but a very few about him who are not ready to obey.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A Prince can never secure himself against a disaffected people, their number being too great, while he may against a disaffected nobility, since their number is small</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Those who so bind themselves, and who are not grasping, should be loved and honoured</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As to those who do not so bind themselves, there is this further distinction. For the most part they are held back by pusillanimity and a natural defect of courage, in which case you should make use of them, and of those among them more especially who are prudent, for they will do you honour in prosperity, and in adversity give you no cause for fear. But where they abstain from attaching themselves to you of set purpose and for ambitious ends, it is a sign that they are thinking more of themselves than of you, and against such men a Prince should be on his guard, and treat them as though they were declared enemies, for in his adversity they will always help to ruin him.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For since men who are well treated by one whom they expected to treat them ill, feel the more beholden to their benefactor, the people will at once become better disposed to such a Prince when he protects them, than if he owed his Princedom to them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But this is the sum of the matter, that it is essential for a Prince to be on a friendly footing with his people, since otherwise, he will have no resource in adversity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He who builds on the people builds on mire,’ for that may be true of a private citizen who presumes on his favour with the people and counts on being rescued by them when overpowered by his enemies or by the magistrates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But when he who builds on the people is a Prince capable of command, of a spirit not to be cast down by ill-fortune, who, while he animates the whole community by his courage and bearing, neglects no prudent precaution, he will not find himself betrayed by the people, but will be seen to have laid his foundations well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In times of peril it is too late for a Prince to assume to himself an absolute authority, for the citizens and subjects who are accustomed to take their orders from the magistrates, will not when dangers threaten take them from the Prince, so that at such seasons there will always be very few in whom he can trust.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In troubled times, when the State has need of its citizens, few of them are to be found. And the risk of the experiment is the greater in that it can only be made once. Wherefore, a wise Prince should devise means whereby his subjects may at all times, whether favourable or adverse, feel the need of the State and of him, and then they will always be faithful to him.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Chapter 10 - How the Strength of All Princedoms Should Be Measured</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To make the matter clearer, I pronounce those to be able to stand alone who, with the men and money at their disposal, can get together an army fit to take the field against any assailant</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For whoever has thoroughly fortified his town, and put himself on such a footing with his subjects as I have already indicated and shall hereafter speak of, will always be attacked with much circumspection; for men are always averse to enterprises that are attended with difficulty, and it is impossible not to foresee difficulties in attacking a Prince whose town is strongly fortified and who is not hated by his subjects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A Prince, therefore, who has a strong city, and who does not make himself hated, can not be attacked</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I answer that a capable and courageous Prince will always overcome these difficulties, now, by holding out hopes to his subjects that the evil will not be of long continuance;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Chapter 12 - How Many Different Kinds of Soldiers There Are, and of Mercenaries</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We see from experience that both Princes and Republics when they depend on their own arms have the greatest success, whereas from employing mercenaries nothing but loss results.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Chapter 13 - Of Auxiliary, Mixed, and National Arms</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Let him, therefore, who would deprive himself of every chance of success, have recourse to auxiliaries, these being far more dangerous than mercenary arms, bringing ruin with them ready made</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In short, with mercenaries your greatest danger is from their inertness and cowardice, with auxiliaries from their valour</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In a word, the armour of others is too wide, or too strait for us; it falls off us, or it weighs us down.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The methods to be followed for organizing a national army may readily be ascertained, if the rules above laid down by me, and by which I abide, be well considered, and attention be given to the manner in which Philip, father of Alexander the Great, and many other Princes and Republics have armed and disposed their forces.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Chapter 14 - Of the Duty of a Prince In Respect of Military Affairs</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>For among other causes of misfortune which your not being armed brings upon you, it makes you despised, and this is one of those reproaches against which, as shall presently be explained, a Prince ought most carefully to guard.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wherefore, as has already been said, a Prince who is ignorant of military affairs, besides other disadvantages, can neither be respected by his soldiers, nor can he trust them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A Prince, therefore, ought never to allow his attention to be diverted from warlike pursuits, and should occupy himself with them even more in peace than in war. This he can do in two ways, by practice or by study.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As it is related that Alexander the Great sought to resemble Achilles, Cæsar Alexander, and Scipio Cyrus.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Chapter 15 - Of the Qualities In Respect of Which Men, and Most of all Princes, Are Praised or Blamed</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>And the manner in which we live, and that in which we ought to live, are things so wide asunder, that he who quits the one to betake himself to the other is more likely to destroy than to save himself</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Chapter 16 - Of Liberality and Miserliness</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To have credit for liberality with the world at large, you must neglect no circumstance of sumptuous display</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A Prince, therefore, if he is enabled thereby to forbear from plundering his subjects, to defend himself, to escape poverty and contempt, and the necessity of becoming rapacious, ought to care little though he incur the reproach of miserliness, for this is one of those vices which enable him to reign.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Either you are already a Prince or you seek to become one; in the former case liberality is hurtful, in the latter it is very necessary that you be thought liberal; Cæsar was one of those who sought the sovereignty of Rome; but if after obtaining it he had lived on without retrenching his expenditure, he must have ruined the Empire.’</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A Prince spends either what belongs to himself and his subjects, or what belongs to others; and that in the former case he ought to be sparing, but in the latter ought not to refrain from any kind of liberality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Of what does not belong to you or to your subjects you should, therefore, be a lavish giver, as were Cyrus, Cæsar, and Alexander; for to be liberal with the property of others does not take from your reputation, but adds to it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What injures you is to give away what is your own. And there is no quality so self-destructive as liberality; for while you practise it you lose the means whereby it can be practised, and become poor and despised, or else, to avoid poverty, you become rapacious and hated. For liberality leads to one or other of these two results, against which, beyond all others, a Prince should guard.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Chapter 17 - Of Cruelty and Clemency, and Whether It Is Better To Be Loved or Feared</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>And here comes in the question whether it is better to be loved rather than feared, or feared rather than loved. It might perhaps be answered that we should wish to be both;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the friendships which we buy with a price, and do not gain by greatness and nobility of character, though they be fairly earned are not made good, but fail us when we have occasion to use them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Moreover, men are less careful how they offend him who makes himself loved than him who makes himself feared.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For love is held by the tie of obligation, which, because men are a sorry breed, is broken on every whisper of private interest; but fear is bound by the apprehension of punishment which never relaxes its grasp.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A Prince should inspire fear in such a fashion that if he do not win love he may escape hate. For a man may very well be feared and yet not hated, and this will be the case so long as he does not meddle with the property or with the women of his citizens and subjects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And if constrained to put any to death, he should do so only when there is manifest cause or reasonable justification</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When a Prince is with his army, and has many soldiers under his command, he must needs disregard the reproach of cruelty, for without such a reputation in its Captain, no army can be held together or kept under any kind of control.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Returning to the question of being loved or feared, I sum up by saying, that since his being loved depends upon his subjects, while his being feared depends upon himself, a wise Prince should build on what is his own, and not on what rests with others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Only, as I have said, he must do his utmost to escape hatred.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Chapter 18 - How Princes Should Keep Faith</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Be it known, then, that there are two ways of contending, one in accordance with the laws, the other by force; the first of which is proper to men, the second to beasts. But since the first method is often ineffectual, it becomes necessary to resort to the second. A Prince should, therefore, understand how to use well both the man and the beast</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Since a Prince should know how to use the beast’s nature wisely, he ought of beasts to choose both the lion and the fox; for the lion cannot guard himself from the toils, nor the fox from wolves. He must therefore be a fox to discern toils, and a lion to drive off wolves.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Of this numberless recent instances could be given, and it might be shown how many solemn treaties and engagements have been rendered inoperative and idle through want of faith in Princes, and that he who was best known to play the fox has had the best success.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is well to seem merciful, faithful, humane, religious, and upright, and also to be so; but the mind should remain so balanced that were it needful not to be so, you should be able and know how to change to the contrary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A Prince should therefore be very careful that nothing ever escapes his lips which is not replete with the five qualities above named, so that to see and hear him, one would think him the embodiment of mercy, good faith, integrity, humanity, and religion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Every one sees what you seem, but few know what you are, and these few dare not oppose themselves to the opinion of the many who have the majesty of the State to back them up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A certain Prince of our own days, whose name it is as well not to mention, is always preaching peace and good faith, although the mortal enemy of both; and both, had he practised them as he preaches them, would, oftener than once, have lost him his kingdom and authority.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="15-november-2021">15 November 2021</h4>
<hr>
<p><strong>Chapter 19 - That a Prince Should Seek to Escape Contempt and Hatred</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A Prince, as has already in part been said, should consider how he may avoid such courses as would make him hated or despised; and that whenever he succeeds in keeping clear of these, he has performed his part, and runs no risk though he incur other infamies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For so long as neither their property nor their honour is touched, the mass of mankind live contentedly, and the Prince has only to cope with the ambition of a few, which can in many ways and easily be kept within bounds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A Prince is despised when he is seen to be fickle, frivolous, effeminate, pusillanimous, or irresolute, against which defects he ought therefore most carefully to guard, striving so to bear himself that greatness, courage, wisdom, and strength may appear in all his actions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In his private dealings with his subjects his decisions should be irrevocable, and his reputation such that no one would dream of overreaching or cajoling him.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Prince who inspires such an opinion of himself is greatly esteemed, and against one who is greatly esteemed conspiracy is difficult; nor, when he is known to be an excellent Prince and held in reverence by his subjects, will it be easy to attack him</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For a Prince is exposed to two dangers, from within in respect of his subjects, from without in respect of foreign powers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not to be hated or despised by the body of his subjects, is one of the surest safeguards that a Prince can have against conspiracy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For he who conspires always reckons on pleasing the people by putting the Prince to death; but when he sees that instead of pleasing he will offend them, he cannot summon courage to carry out his design</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I say that on the side of the conspirator there are distrust, jealousy, and dread of punishment to deter him, while on the side of the Prince there are the laws, the majesty of the throne, the protection of friends and of the government to defend him; to which if the general good-will of the people be added, it is hardly possible that any should be rash enough to conspire</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well ordered States and wise Princes have provided with extreme care that the nobility shall not be driven to desperation, and that the commons shall be kept satisfied and contented; for this is one of the most important matters that a Prince has to look to.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Princes should devolve on others those matters that entail responsibility, and reserve to themselves those that relate to grace and favour.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And again I say that a Prince should esteem the great, but must not make himself odious to the people.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Since we find that some among them who had always lived good lives, and shown themselves possessed of great qualities, were nevertheless deposed and even put to death by their subjects who had conspired against them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For as Princes cannot escape being hated by some, they should, in the first place, endeavour not to be hated by a class; failing in which, they must do all they can to escape the hatred of that class which is the stronger.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From the causes indicated it resulted that Marcus, Pertinax, and Alexander, being Princes of a temperate disposition, lovers of justice, enemies of cruelty, gentle, and kindly, had all, save Marcus, an unhappy end.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Here it is to be noted that hatred is incurred as well on account of good actions as of bad; or which reason, as I have already said, a Prince who would maintain his authority is often compelled to be other than good</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You must needs adapt yourself to its humours, and satisfy these, in which case virtuous conduct will only prejudice you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because his actions, for one who was a new Prince, were thus remarkable, I will point out shortly how well he understood to play the part both of the lion and of the fox, each of which natures, as I have observed before, a Prince should know how to assume.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whoever, therefore, examines carefully the actions of this Emperor, will find in him all the fierceness of the lion and all the craft of the fox</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Princes of our own days are less troubled with the difficulty of having to make constant efforts to keep their soldier in good humour</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In short, a Prince new to the Princedom cannot imitate the actions of Marcus, nor is it necessary that he should imitate all those of Severus; but he should borrow from Severus those parts of his conduct which are needed to serve as a foundation for his government, and from Marcus those suited to maintain it, and render it glorious when once established.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Chapter 20 - Whether Fortresses, and Certain Other Expedients to Which Princes Often Have Recourse, are Profitable or Hurtful</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>For the difference which those whom you supply with arms perceive in their treatment, will bind them to you, while the others will excuse you, recognizing that those who incur greater risk and responsibility merit greater rewards. But by disarming, you at once give offence, since you show your subjects that you distrust them, either as doubting their courage, or as doubting their fidelity, each of which imputations begets hatred against you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When a Prince acquires a new State, which thus becomes joined on like a limb to his old possessions, he must disarm its inhabitants, except such of them as have taken part with him while he was acquiring it;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For I do not believe that divisions purposely caused can ever lead to good; on the contrary, when an enemy approaches, divided cities are lost at once, for the weaker faction will always side with the invader, and the other will not be able to stand alone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Doubtless, Princes become great by vanquishing difficulties and opposition, and Fortune, on that account, when she desires to aggrandize a new Prince, who has more need than an hereditary Prince to win reputation, causes enemies to spring up, and urges them on to attack him, to the end that he may have opportunities to overcome them, and make his ascent by the very ladder which they have planted</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lord of Siena, governed his State by the instrumentality of those whom he had at one time distrusted, in preference to all others</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This only I will say, that those men who at the beginning of a reign have been hostile, if of a sort requiring support to maintain them, may always be won over by the Prince with much ease, and are the more bound to serve him faithfully because they know that they have to efface by their conduct the unfavourable impression he had formed of them</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A Prince always obtains better help from them, than from those who serving him in too complete security neglect his affairs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He will perceive that it is far easier to secure the friendship of those who being satisfied with things as they stood, were for that very reason his enemies, than of those who sided with him and aided him in his usurpation only because they were discontented.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We may state the case thus: the Prince who is more afraid of his subjects than of strangers ought to build fortresses, while he who is more afraid of strangers than of his subjects, should leave them alone</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Chapter 21 - How a Prince Should Bear Himself So As to Acquire Reputation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A Prince is likewise esteemed who is a stanch friend and a thorough foe, that is to say, who without reserve openly declares for one against another, this being always a more</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And it will always happen that he who is not your friend will invite you to neutrality, while he who is your friend will call on you to declare yourself openly in arms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When both combatants are of such limited strength that whichever wins you have no cause to fear, it is all the more prudent for you to take a side, for you will then be ruining the one with the help of the other, who were he wise would endeavour to save him. If he whom you help conquers, he remains in your power, and with your aid he cannot but conquer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prudence therefore consists in knowing how to distinguish degrees of disadvantage, and in accepting a less evil as a good.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This man shall not be deterred from beautifying his possessions from the apprehension that they may be taken from him, or that other refrain from opening a trade through fear of taxes; and he should provide rewards for those who desire so to employ themselves, and for all who are disposed in any way to add to the greatness of his City or State.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Always maintaining the dignity of his station, which must under no circumstances be compromised.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Chapter 22 - Of the Secretaries of Princes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>As to how a Prince is to know his Minister, this unerring rule may be laid down. When you see a Minister thinking more of himself than of you, and in all his actions seeking his own ends, that man can never be a good Minister or one that you can trust</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the other hand, to keep his Minister good, the Prince should be considerate of him, dignifying him, enriching him, binding him to himself by benefits, and sharing with him the honours as well as the burthens of the State, so that the abundant honours and wealth bestowed upon him may divert him from seeking them at other hand</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Chapter 23 - That Flatterers Should Be Shunned</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Father Luke, who is attached to the Court of the present Emperor Maximilian, in speaking of his Majesty told me, that he seeks advice from none, yet never has his own way; and this from his following a course contrary to that above recommended. For being of a secret disposition, he never discloses his intentions to any, nor asks their opinion; and it is only when his plans are to be carried out that they begin to be discovered and known, and at the same time they begin to be thwarted by those he has about him, when he being facile gives way. Hence it happens that what he does one day, he undoes the next; that his wishes and designs are never fully ascertained; and that it is impossible to build on his resolves.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For there is no way to guard against flattery but by letting it be seen that you take no offense in hearing the truth: but when every one is free to tell you the truth respect falls short. Wherefore a prudent Prince should follow a middle course, by choosing certain discreet men from among his subjects, and allowing them alone free leave to speak their minds on any matter on which he asks their opinion, and on none other.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Prince should hearken to no others, but should follow the course determined on, and afterwards adhere firmly to his resolves</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A Prince who is not wise himself cannot be well advised by others, unless by chance he surrender himself to be wholly governed by some one adviser who happens to be supremely prudent; in which case he may, indeed, be well advised; but not for long, since such an adviser will soon deprive him of his Government.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It follows that good counsels, whencesoever they come, have their origin in the prudence of the Prince, and not the prudence of the Prince in wise counsels.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Chapter 24 - Why the Princes of Italy Have Lost Their States</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>For men are more nearly touched by things present than by things past, and when they find themselves well off as they are, enjoy their felicity and seek no further; nay, are ready to do their utmost in defence of the new Prince, provided he be not wanting to himself in other respects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Those modes of defence are alone good, certain and lasting, which depend upon yourself and your own worth.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Chapter 25 - What Fortune Can Effect in Human Affairs, and How She May Be Withstood</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>For Fortune is a woman who to be kept under must be beaten and roughly handled; and we see that she suffers herself to be more readily mastered by those who so treat her than by those who are more timid in their approaches. And always, like a woman, she favours the young, because they are less scrupulous and fiercer, and command her with greater audacity.</li>
