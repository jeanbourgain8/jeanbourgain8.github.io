## 4th Nov'21
As of now, it's 8:20 pm, I'm on 52th page of the book. Before starting my read, my involuntarily set objectives were to know the following :

-   What is that makes the author so famous ? 
-   My experience with mystery got piqued after reading a couple of books from Perry Mason Collection, now, for a change I wanted to see how other named authors works would be, so, I picked one of Agatha Christie's    
-   What all insights I should pick from the readings ?    
-   Can the detective in this beat out Perry Mason's ?
    

So far, the book's been okayish, till now I see only environment setting-up happening, slipping into the core plot seems to have just started, I'm excited to check Poirot's abilities. The grammar & style of words seems very untimely & sophisticated enough for me to doubt it.

## 6th Nov'21

I've finished reading the book, on whole, it's an one time read. If there is anything that I'll take home from the book, that would be, its unconventional sentences, quite different from what I'm aware of. If & when I wish to grasp it, then I'll shall read again. Finally, I've read one of Agatha Christie's, this will be my first non-fiction read, in a typical sense.

I did observe the emphasis placed on parallel, case-based thinking, it provided me a positive feeling, as, I've been trying to get back to that style of thinking for some days, after having taken a good break from it. I'm also eager to compare the protaganist with Perry Mason's, I shall one day, do it.

Concluding, It's a breezy read, it won't take much time to finish, hold your expectations moderate.
