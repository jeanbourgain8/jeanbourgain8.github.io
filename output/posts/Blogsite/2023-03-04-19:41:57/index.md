# 1. Need some extra time 

In this regard, to join the PhD program at ISI-Delhi,  from Oct'22 I have started working towards picking up basics of the subjects with the help of M.A. Economics course at IGNOU. I felt it was the best option available for me to pursue remotely, simultaneously I would also earn a degree. If in case, not even in my wildest dreams I would allow, but if anything goes wrong with the UPSC-CSE, I can appear for Indian Economic Services ( for which M.A. Economics is compulsory) as a backup option. 

Though the ISI-JRF (QE) exam primarily focuses on foundational depth with some deducable patterns existing in the questions asked - Utility Maximization, Theory of Choice, Econometrics Basics + Dev Econ., Time Series Basics, Growth Models, Nash & Sub-Perfect Nash Equilibrium (one year they were missing). I came across some instances where the terminologies appearing in the exam which are not quite common at the first instance for someone like me who just got started in Oct'22 (Ex: $2^{nd}$ Question's Perfect Labour Mobility in QEB, 2018 etc.) .

If not for both ISI-JRF & IGNOU exams, I would have strictly confined myself to Microeconomic Theory and covered as much material as possible restricting exclusively to the following topics at first - **Theory of Choice, Equilibrium & Welfare, Game Theory, Mechanism Design, Auction Theory etc.**, starting with your notes for the foundations build up.  
But lately, I'm having a feeling that I will need some extra time inorder to cover these topics more extensively & concretely, especially with UPSC-CSE preparation heavily constraing my time. Also to fill my knowledge gaps in Econometrics (despite my prior familiarity with Max. Likelihood, Regression etc. in Machine Learning) & Macroeconomic Theory (being broad in subject). I may have completed 1st year M.A. Economics - IGNOU exams already in Dec'22-Jan'23, but I did not find their materials sufficient enough to cover the breadth & depth needed. I found them a lot more verbose.

<summary>[Click to Expand] <strong>Clash of UPSC - CSE, ISI-JRF (QE), Indian Economic Services, 2nd year M.A. Economics - IGNOU Exams </strong></summary>
<br>
UPSC-CSE being primarily a memory-based exam and me aiming for securing a top-rank in it, a major portion of my day-time gets consumed by it, in addition its Mathematics Syllabus is more wider than deeper (almost equivalent to M.Sc Level). If it is not for Mathematics & its vast syllabus (advantage is fetches more marks), UPSC-CSE would have been much easier to be done away with.
All of the exams happening around the same months is making it quite difficult for me to optimally allocate my attention & memory to obtain the best results in all. To my luck/bad-luck 2nd year M.A. Economics exams of IGNOU and Indian Economic Services are clashing with the exam dates, preparation for these two has been demanding a lot of my head memory more than others, both of them are verbose. <br>
So, for their sheer size in material and also clashing of dates, I have decided not to appear for Indian Economic Services Exam this year & postponed my plan to give my 2nd year M.A. Economics exams of IGNOU to Dec'2023. <br>
With this, only two exams remain - UPSC-CSE (Prelims in May'23 & Mains in Sept'23) & ISI-JRF (in May'23) to tackle currently, yet both being in May'2023 (UPSC - Prelims) with contrasting demands of the subjects, especially memory management which is heaviy required for UPSC-CSE. In addition to this, QEA of ISI-JRF (QE) requires Probability & Statistics, Optimization etc. (though not very deeply), UPSC-CSE (Maths) held in Sept'23 demands primary focus on ODEs, PDEs, Mathematical Physics - Mechanics, Fluid Dynamics, Group Theory, Real Analysis etc., with only Linear Algebra & Calculus being common to both.

All in All, despite cutting down the number of exams (UPSC-CSE, ISI-JRF, UPSC-IES, 2nd yr @ M.A. - IGNOU) to appear in to two, both UPSC-CSE & ISI-JRF are being quite demanding in subjects breadth within this very less time, it has become quite difficult for me to memory manage & work towards producing best results in both, especially to secure a top rank in UPSC-CSE when preparing without any established guidance. To address this problem, I have found a solution but I would like to check them with you and verify before I proceed. 

# 2. Queries 

1. **Instead of appearing for the exam in May'23 and joining the campus in Aug'23, Can I instead seek an admission starting from Sept'23 for the PhD Program?** I'm willing to take whatever examination the admission board requires me to - written/interview/both etc.
   <details>
   <summary>[Click to Expand] <strong>Explanation:</strong></summary>
   Since, it is being difficult to memory manage for both exams UPSC-CSE & ISI-JRF being held in May'23. In this regard, taking note of the exception that exists on ISI's - Economics Planning Unit webpage attached below. Can I seek an admission instead by taking the examination test the admission board requires me in order to start from Sept'23 ? <br>
   
   <p><img src="/images/JRF%20Webpage.png"></img></p><br>
   By doing this, I can provide maximum attention <strong>towards securing a top-rank in UPSC-CSE</strong> at first and finish the written exams by Sept'23. Also, this would provide me more than enough time (since I have started Economics only in Oct'22) to concretely establish my foundations strongly in Micro Theory - Choice, Equilibrium  & Welfare, Game Theory, Mechanism Design,  Auctions & Network Theory. Additionally, this will give me enough time to fill my knowledge gaps in Econometrics & Macro Theory (emphasising on parts involving micro elements) lot more beyond the demands of the ISI-JRF Exam. <br>
   Above all, I get to have enough time to do an in-depth analysis on some recent papers and understand the trends and directions of research more concretely. 
   By getting done away with UPSC-CSE exam (securing a top-rank), I can whole-heartedly dedicate myself to research without having to worry about career planning and family at home much.

2. **Is ISI-JRF (QE) exam the only way to join the PhD program with a fellowship ? Will I be offered JRF Fellowship for starting from Sept'23 ? Otherwise, Can I begin my PhD program with your SERB CRG grant for the period Sept'23 - Jul'24 as mentioned on Economic Planning Unit's (EPU) webpage and clear the exam next year in May'2024 for JRF Fellowship ?** 
   <details>
   <summary>[Click to Expand] <strong>Explanation:</strong></summary>
   Going by the instructions mentioned on the EPU's PhD program webpage, I will probably be ineligible for JRF Fellowship untill I clear the exam in the next year (2024) since I'm planning to get my admission in PhD program starting from Sept'23. In this regard, I would like to know whether after clearing the test with admission board will you be able to offer me fellowship in equivalent terms from  your SERB CRG grant as mentioned on EPU's Announcements webpage, attached below.<br>
   <p><img src="/images/SERB%20Grant.png"></img> </p><br>
   Also, with no doubts in my mind. I will clear UPSC-CSE this year and will not require any JRF Fellowship starting after Aug'24, except for travel grants, book-purchases, journal access etc.
   </details>
3. **As I will be joining almost by the end of Sept'23, will I be allowed to directly appear for the 1st Semester Term-End Exams or will there be any conditional for missing the Mid-Terms in the 1st Semester ? Are there any ways in which I can compensate them by giving my Mid-Terms seperately after joining at the end of Sept'23 ?** 
   <details>
   <summary>[Click to Expand] <strong>Explanation:</strong></summary>
   Since, joining in Sept'23 will provide me good enough time, I will by default finish off reading the standard references related to courses in the1st semester, except for the seminar courses before taking admission in Sept'23. For a quick reference, I will mention a list of resources below for you to verify and suggest any additions or corrections necessary. I am ready to take whatever conditional the authority will seek from me to compensate for the mid-terms.
