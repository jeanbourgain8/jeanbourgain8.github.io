<h2 id="statement-of-purpose">Statement of Purpose</h2>
<hr>
<h3 id="1-introduction">1. Introduction</h3>
<p>To my fortune, I found a great <strong>opportunity</strong> in <strong>Sept'2022</strong>, which was the same month in which I gave my UPSC-CSE (Mains) Exam in 2022. This <strong>opportunity</strong> has profoundly excited me to an extent that, I was even ready to deliberately flunk my exam (only to appear again next year - 2023). Before this, I had half-heartedly accepted &amp; planned to delay my research pursuit for 5-7 years to comply with the rules of govt. (min. time one should spend in the service to obtain a study leave). But, this discovery of <strong>opportunity</strong> has <strong>rekindled</strong> my spirit to pursue research without having to delay it any further. <br>
Prior to this discovery, my actual plan was to appear in UPSC-CSE (for IAS/IFS), finish my M.A. Economics at IGNOU so that I can appear for Indian Economic Services as a backup option.  </p>
<p>Now naturally, it might occur to you, if I'm so interested in research, with so many opportunities out there, be it at Google/Microsoft/Amazon Research labs, many other MNCs to work on Electronic Commerce/Algos/Networks etc. </p>
<p><strong>Why don't I pursue research single-mindedly and become a Research Scientist/Professor ?</strong></p>
<p>In Jun'2019, I have made a steadfast decision to work for the state (govt.) as an organisation, in an administrative position, be it either in Administrative/Foreign Services, and pursue research as a <strong>habit</strong> (<strong>not as a hobby</strong>; but <strong>with dedication</strong>). Also, the fact that I find it very hard &amp; contrasting to my personality, to dedicate myself to one particular area/subject for an extended period of time (&gt;15+ yrs), has completely ruled out the option for me to even think of becoming a full-time professor. That's why, to work for the state in an administrative capacity &amp; also to retain the felixibility in my breadth of interests - Maths, Theoretical CS &amp; Economics etc., I have chosen this particular path - Civil Services + Research (as a habit).</p>
<h3 id="2-why-isi-delhi">2. Why ISI-Delhi ?</h3>
<p>Although it doesn't recommend, I have observed that ISI-Delhi provides an unique opportunity. It is open to the possibility of people pursuing their PhD remotely (not full-time). In my enquiry, I have come to know that there are people who are pursuing/have pursued research <strong>part-time</strong> (Ex: Leena Kumar etc.). <strong>Now, this possibility has come to me as an absolute blessing</strong>. I do not have to wait/delay my plan of pursuing research any further for 5-7 years.   </p>
<p><em><strong>Note</strong>: By part-time I only mean to indicate the constraint of time but not its seriousness.</em></p>
<p>I believe that, doing a PhD at ISI-Delhi would provide me an access to excellent research community and equip me with tools and network to transform myself succesfully into a Theoretical Economist. Also, professionally, while working in the service (IFS), ISI being an Indian University would allow me to do a PhD simultaneously with minimal interference/restrictions from the govt. side. In every way, starting with <strong>Prof. Debasis Mishra &amp; Prof. Arunava Sen</strong>, institute's quality of research, its norms and independence etc., for many such reasons, I cannot of think of any place other than ISI -Delhi, which can fit perfectly well with my aspirations.<br>
Hence, I named the title of this post as <strong>"My Tryst with ISI-Delhi"</strong>. </p>
<h3 id="3-why-prof-debasis-mishra">3. Why Prof. Debasis Mishra ?</h3>
<p>Based on my observations, Prof. Debasis Mishra as much a Microeconomic Theorist that he is,  he also seems to have an inclination towards theoretical aspects outside of economics, I have deduced this based on, <strong>his research in Mechanism Design, Game Theory</strong> (Multi-Agents) (areas primarily being the fields related to economics, but recently, are also seeing an increasing influx of people from different fields), <strong>his stint at IISC-CSA after his PhD</strong>, <strong>his past association with David C. Parkes</strong> who is currently leading a group working on Economics &amp; Computation etc., <strong>gaurentee me that I can ocassionally experiment beyond Microeconomics during my PhD</strong>. In addition, while picking up economic analysis concepts from him, in exchange, I will bring new insights/ideas to the table from my prior experience &amp; inclinations in areas outside of economics, making it a win-win for both.</p>
<p>The <strong>same alma mater</strong> adds a sense of security, especially in cases of any exigencies that may arise during my PhD (Ex: My current plan to take a delayed admission into the PhD program etc.). Another strong reason adding to the list is, I always had special appreciation for professors who put out their lecture notes in public. </p>
<p>For the above and many more such reasons, I strongly feel that he will be a perfect advisor for me. Added bonus is, I can also look forward to some association with Prof. Arunava Sen in choice concepts, which is why ISI-Delhi is simply the best fit for me. </p>
<h3 id="4-why-a-phd">4. Why a PhD ?</h3>
<p><strong>"Okay, shouldn't this be talked at first ?!"</strong>, <br><strong>Hmmm, Yes!</strong>, this is a reverse of usual order - <strong>Why ? Who ? Where ?</strong>   </p>
<p>As I have established already before, I made a steadfast decision to become part of either Administrative/Foreign service. But that doesn't mean I have to forgo my interest for research in theory, it was only a compromise (half-heartedly done) I had accepted for the decisions I took. I chose to delay my pursuit of PhD for 5-7 years. </p>
<h4 id="41-theoretical-economics-succcurlyeq-theoretical-cs">4.1 Theoretical Economics $\succcurlyeq$ Theoretical CS</h4>
<p>After spending some time working on projects till Jun'2019 in resolving the dilemma of my future pursuit between Theory &amp; Applied aspects of Machine Learning (for more details check <a href="../2023-02-23-17%3A38%3A35/">this post</a>), I have realised that my inclination was more towards Theory. Since then, I've been exploring (briefly) theory in different areas apart from Machine Learning within the Computer Science (Algorithmic Game Theory, Approximation Algos, Graph Theory &amp; Combinatorics etc.), keeping myself updated with the new materials, directions and trends. </p>
<details><summary> [Click to Expand] <strong>Some professors I follow in Computer Science</strong></summary><br>
Prahlad Harsha &amp; Others. at TIFR, Siddharth Barman (Fair Division) at IISC &amp; groups working at Google &amp; Microsoft Research in India, U.Penn (Sampath Kannan), UW (Anna Karlin, Sebastien Bubeck, Yin-Tat-Lee etc.), UCSD (Shachar Lovett, Daniel Kane etc.), UIUC (Sariel Har-Peled, Jugal Garg, Ruta Mehta etc.), Princeton (Matt Weinberg etc.), Harvard (Madhusudhan etc.), CMU (Pradeep Ravikumar, Venkatesh Guruswami etc.) and many other groups at MIT (Constantinos Daskalakis etc.), UC Berkeley (Prasad Raghavendra, Moritz Hardt etc.), Columbia (Tim Roughgarden etc.), UW-Madison (Nowak, Suchi Chawla moved to UT-Austin etc.), Stanford (Andrea Montanari, etc.) &amp; people at many others places - UWaterloo, Toronto, Oxford, ETHZ, EPFL etc.
<br></details><p><br> 
Within India, I have found the research directions of Prof. Siddharth Barman at IISC interesting. So, I have made a note to work with him, if and when I plan to pursue my PhD in future. Now, in <strong>Sept'22</strong>, when I found that similar works (in intersection of Maths, CS &amp; Economics) are being done from Economics standpoint at ISI-Delhi, right away I got fixated to their PhD opportunity. All of a sudden, I re-configured all my career plans and revived my PhD interest, which earlier was pushed back. </p>
<p>After this re-aligning of my interests with Economics as my primary focus from Theoretical CS, <strong>Prof. Debasis Mishra &amp; Prof. Arunava Sen have become the crown jewels to my this new world</strong>.<br>
And, "<ins><strong>the possibility of pursuing research remotely</strong></ins>" plus "<ins><strong>positive comments from students about Prof. Debasis Mishra's  mentorship</strong></ins>" only made this positive feeling even more concrete. </p>
<p>Altogether, PhD has always been part of my plan, it's just the matter of time (when) that's changed.  </p>
<h3 id="5-how-will-phd-benefit">5. How will PhD benefit ?</h3>
<p>Now, I'll come to the cherry on top aspect of this entire PhD plan. While entering the UPSC-CSE journey, I wanted to become part of the Administrative Service (IAS) more than Foreign Service (IFS), but later after realising the demands of work beyond usual hours in the initials year of IAS, I was nudged to rethink about my choice, because some personal time to pursue either science or any other interests is non-negotiable to me, I feel this part of freedom is something very hard for me to forgo. Yet, I've affirmed to pursue IAS based on a personal compromise that I can pursue reasearch after 5-7 years by taking a study leave. </p>
<p>But this discovery of a possibility to do a PhD at ISI-Delhi, has reinvigorated my spirit and changed all my plans. I changed my first preference to Foreign Services (IFS).  As far as I'm aware of, the initial years though demand responsibility, one will find enough time to pursue their interests while being in the service (IFS).</p>
<p><strong>The Cherry of this PhD Plan:</strong> The change of my primary area of research from Theoretical CS to Theoretical Economics - Mechanism Design, Game Theory, Choices, Auctions, Networks etc., all of these topics concern with the operations happening in strategic environments, which is exactly the core aspect of IFS job. This convergence of my research and professional interests is a blessing to me. Also, by obtaining a PhD in Economics, I will by default get to lead the Economics Wing within the Foreign Services Divisions. </p>
<p><strong>Thus, in the end, my personal, professional &amp; all kinds of interests are converging together into one beautiful circle.</strong></p>
