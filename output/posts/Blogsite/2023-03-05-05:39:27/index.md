# 1. Background Information

I started my research pursuit with [Bio-Medical Devices & Imaging](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1baLe5P9N5wIfxbIhuJDW9uw_jOTpaQQU/view?usp=sharing), [Instrumentation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IwRRM0X6Xsn-6FphBChUmscy894OCHYl/view)[^1] and have travelled a long road experimenting in different areas - [Machine Learning](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LS3Y6dzPuQ-YZN2ZHMHlZPWwNeGkSEyo/view?usp=sharing)[^2] - [Applied](https://github.com/anhttran/3dmm_cnn)[^3] [&](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1y33JUi8W0MT1X8cHpywhF-WbSSGmsKKO?usp=sharing)[^4] [Theory](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hmHOy27Xk3FgPk-aof9BHi59bLE3XmL4/view)(thesis)[^5], [3D](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.00523v1.pdf)[^6] -  [Face](https://flame.is.tue.mpg.de/)[^7], [Body](https://smpl-x.is.tue.mpg.de/)[^8] [Reconstruction](https://grail.cs.washington.edu/projects/AudioToObama/)[^9], SLAM (typically called as [NERFs](https://grail.cs.washington.edu/projects/personnerf/)[^10] recently) etc. where some happened to be co-incidental (includes job at HPE) with the trends and others well thought ones (like exploring Theory). 

It was only in Jun'2019, I have concretely realized that my interests primarily lie in the intersection of Maths, Theoretical CS & Economics subjects, and resolved to pursue research in these subjects for the coming next 10-15 years. I was supposed to join in one of Masters CS programs starting from June'2019 but for some specific reasons, and also having realized by then already that I like Theory a lot more than the Applied aspects of research, I have dropped my masters plan abroad (avoiding to spend huge sums) and chose the path of Civil Services with a plan to do a PhD down the line after 5-7 years being in the service (which is allowed complying with the service rules).
