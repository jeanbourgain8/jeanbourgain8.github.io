<h3 id="introduction-to-a-possibility">Introduction to a Possibility ?</h3>
<p>Dear Sir, to my fortune I have found a great <strong>possibility</strong> in <strong>Sept'2022</strong>, which was the same month in which I gave my UPSC-CSE (Mains) Exam. The <strong>possibility</strong> has profoundly excited me to an extent where I almost got ready to deliberately flunk the exam (only to appear in next year - 2023). Till then, I have half-heartedly accepted &amp; planned to delay my research pursuit for 5-7 years to comply with the rules of govt. (min. time one should spend to obtain a study leave), but this discovery of a <strong>possibility</strong> has <strong>rekindled</strong> my spirit to pursue research without having to delay it any further. Prior to this, my actual plan was to appear in UPSC-CSE (IAS &amp; IFS), finish my M.A. Economics at IGNOU so that I can appear for Indian Economic Services as a backup option. </p>
<p>Naturally, it might occur to you when I'm so interested in research <strong>"Why not I pursue it single-mindedly and become a Research Scientist/Professor ? "</strong> with much wider opportunities existing today on Electronic Commerce/Networks etc., be it at Google/Microsoft/Amazon Research and many other MNCs. In 2019 (mid) I have made a steadfast decision to work for the state(govt.) as an organisation in an administrative position be it either in Administrative/Foreign Services and pursue research as a <strong>habit</strong> (<strong>not as a hobby</strong>; but with dedication). Also, the fact that I find it very hard/challenging &amp; contrasting to my personality to dedicate myself to one particular area/subject for an extended period of time (&gt;10-15 yrs) has ruled out the choice/possibility of even thinking to become a full-time professor. That's why, to work for the state in an administrative capacity &amp; also to retain independence in my breadth of interests - Maths, Theoretical CS &amp; Economics etc., I have chosen this path.   </p>
<h3 id="now-what-is-this-possibility">Now, What is this Possibility ?</h3>
<p>I have observed that ISI-Delhi provides an opportunity though not recommended yet it is open to consider a possibility for one to pursue their PhD remotely (not as a full-time). In my enquiry, I have come to know that there are people who are pursuing/have pursued research part-time (Ex: Leena Kumar etc.). Now, this option has come to me as a blessing. I do not have to wait/delay my plan of pursuing research further for 5-7 years more. <br>
Sir, In 2019(mid) after spending some time on resolving the dilemma of my interest between Theory &amp; Applied aspects of Machine Learning, I have realised that my inclincation was more towards Theory. Since then, starting with theoretical aspects of machine learning I've been exploring (briefly) theory in different areas within the computer science (Algorithmic Game Theory, Approximation Algos, Graph Theory &amp; Combinatorics etc.) and also been looking at the directions of works by theorists like Prof. Prahlad Harsha &amp; others at TIFR etc., Prof. Siddharth Barman (Fair Division) &amp; groups at Google &amp; Microsoft Research in India, U.Penn (Sampath Kannan), UIUC (Jugal Garg, Ruta Mehta etc. - strong working group in Game Theory), Princeton (Matt Weinberg etc.) and other groups at MIT, Stanford etc.</p>
<p>Only recently, after re-aligning my interests with Economics as primary focus from Theoretical CS, <strong>I have found ISI-Delhi with You &amp; Prof. Arunava Sen as crown jewels to my world</strong>. Adding to this, "<ins><strong>the possibility of pursuing research remotely</strong></ins>" has only made the feeling even more concrete. In this regard, from Oct'22 I have started to pickup the basics of the subjects with the help of M.A. Economics course at IGNOU. I felt that it was the best option, simultaneously I could also earn a degree. Also, in my wildest dreams if anything goes wrong with the UPSC-CSE, I can appear for Indian Economic Services (M.A. Economics Compulsory) as a backup with the help of it. </p>
<h3 id="now-what-is-the-problem">Now, What is the Problem ?</h3>
<p>Sir, although the ISI-JRF (QE) exam primarily focuses on foundational depth with some deducable patterns in the questions asked - Utility Maximization, Choice, Econometrics Basics, Time Series Basics, Growth Models &amp; Nash Equilibrium &amp; Sub-Perfect (some years they were missed). I came across some instances where the terminologies which are not quite common at the first instance (Ex: $2^{nd}$ Question's Perfect Labour Mobility in QEB, 2018 etc.) appear in the exam. 
If not for both ISI-JRF, IGNOU exams, I would have strictly confined myself to Microeconomic Theory and would have tried to cover as much material as possible on Theory of Choice, Game Theory, Mechanism Design &amp; Auction Theory + Mathematical Programming (for Graphs for Networks &amp; Linear Programming). Since, the exam is a competitive one and people who have been studying these subjects for almost 5 years (B.A + M.A) appear for the exam, I feel that I will need some extra time to cover the above topics broadly and concretely and also fill my gaps of knowledge in Econometrics &amp; Macroeconomic Theory. UPSC-CSE being primarily a memory-based exam and me trying to secure a top-rank in the exam, it is requiring a major portion of my day-time along with its Mathematics Syllabus (almost equivalent to M.Sc Level). If it is not for Mathematics &amp; it's vast syllabus (but fetches more marks), I think UPSC-CSE would have been much easier to be done away with.
All of the exams happening around the same time, it has become quite difficult for me to optimally allocate my attention &amp; memory in order to obtain best results in all, where all of them being competitive. To my luck/bad-luck my 2nd year M.A. Economics exams of IGNOU are clashing with Indian Economic Services exam dates, preparation for these two has been demanding a lot of my memory space, both of them being verbose. So, for their sheer size in material and also clashing of dates I have decided not to appear for Indian Economic Services Exam this year &amp; also give my 2nd year M.A. Economics exams in Dec'2023. With this only UPSC-CSE &amp; ISI-JRF (QE) exams remain, yet both the exams also being in May'2023 and demands of the subjects are being quite contrasting, although QEA of ISI-JRF (QE) requires Probability &amp; Statistics, Optimization etc., UPSC-CSE (Maths) has contrasting requirements with primary focus going towards ODEs, PDEs, Mathematical Physics, Group Theory, Real Analysis etc., 
All in All, despite cutting down the number of exams, both of them being enourmous in size demands, it has become quite difficult for me to manage in order to produce the best results in both. To address these problems I have found a solution but I would like to check with them and verify before I can proceed. </p>
<h3 id="what-to-do">What to Do ?</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Instead of appearing for the exam in May'23 and joining the campus in Aug'23, Can I instead seek admissoin starting from Sept'23 ?</strong> If I'm ready to take any kind of examination which the admission board demands from me - written/interview etc.
   <strong>Solution:</strong> By doing this I can provide maximum attention to UPSC-CSE untill I finsh off the exams in Sept'23. Also, this would provide me more than enough time for me to concretely establish my foundation strongly in Micro Theory - Choice &amp; Welfare, Game Theory, Mechanism Design &amp; Auctions, Network Theory I will also try to extend my knowledge after initially covering your notes at first  in these topics. Also, I shall fill my gaps in the knowledge of Econometrics &amp; Macro Theory by that time much more beyond the requirements of the ISI-JRF Exam. Once, I get done away with UPSC-CSE properly by securing a top-rank, I will whole-heartedly be able to dedicate myself to research.</li>
<li>
<strong>Is ISI-JRF (QE) exam the only way to join the PhD program with a fellowship ? Can I instead start my PhD program on your SERB grant for the period Sept'23 - Jul'24 and clear the exam in 2024 for JRF ?</strong> So that, in future despite of getting into Civil Services, I will be eligible for grants to conferences, book-purchasing etc.</li>

<h4 id="how-did-i-zero-in-on-isi-delhi">How did I zero in on ISI-Delhi ?</h4>
<p>I started my research pursuit with <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1baLe5P9N5wIfxbIhuJDW9uw_jOTpaQQU/view?usp=sharing">Bio-Medical Devices &amp; Imaging</a>, <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IwRRM0X6Xsn-6FphBChUmscy894OCHYl/view">Instrumentation</a> and have walked a long path experimenting in different areas - <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LS3Y6dzPuQ-YZN2ZHMHlZPWwNeGkSEyo/view?usp=sharing">Machine Learning</a> (<a href="https://github.com/anhttran/3dmm_cnn">Applied</a> <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1y33JUi8W0MT1X8cHpywhF-WbSSGmsKKO?usp=sharing">&amp;</a> <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hmHOy27Xk3FgPk-aof9BHi59bLE3XmL4/view">Theory</a>), <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.00523v1.pdf">3D</a> <a href="https://flame.is.tue.mpg.de/">Face</a>, <a href="https://smpl-x.is.tue.mpg.de/">Body</a> <a href="https://grail.cs.washington.edu/projects/AudioToObama/">Reconstruction</a>, SLAM (typically called as <a href="https://grail.cs.washington.edu/projects/personnerf/">NERFs</a> recently) etc. where some happened to be co-incidental (includes job at HPE) with the trends and others well thought ones (exploring Theory). For this, I do believe that my graduation course is also partly responsible where unlike other core branches such as EE, ECE, CS etc., Instrumentation Engg. curriculum at IIT-KGP happens to be a mix of all three with little specific to Instrumentation, limited by its extent of applications. It was only in 2019 (mid) I have concretely realized that my interests primarily lie in the intersection of Maths, Theoretical CS &amp; Economics subjects, and resolved to pursue research for the coming next 10-15 years in these fields. I was supposed to join in one of Masters CS programs starting from June'2019 but for some specific reasons, and also having realized by then already that I like Theory a lot more than the Applied aspects of research, I have dropped my masters plan abroad (avoiding to spend any sums) and chose the path of Civil Services with a plan to do a PhD down the line after 5-7 years being in the service (which is allowed complying with the rules). Till then, I actually planned to pursue research independently more as a habit and enter into a PhD program in future with problems identified well beforehand to work upon.</p>
