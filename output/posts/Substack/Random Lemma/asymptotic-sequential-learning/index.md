> A review of paper from (Journal of Economics), published by Omer Tamuz's Group

<!-- TEASER_END -->
In brief this paper tries to focus on the convergance rate and its dependencies on actions and signals. They try to prove that the convergence occurs quickly with respect to signals *external observations* rather than actions using a two state stochastic process. Taking the case of Gaussian distribution as the signal distribution they prove that the convergence with respect to actions occurs by $(\sqrt{\log t})$ times faster. They also discuss the definitivity of the convergence. 
They were also emphasizing on the sublinerity of the actions influence. Sublinearity means $(\lim\limits_{n \to \infty} \frac{x_n}{n})$
