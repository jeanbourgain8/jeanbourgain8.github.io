<p>This is very usual phenomena for anyone who steps into adulthood, we question everything &amp; try to find out answers for them.</p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<ul>
<li>Biotechnology is technology that utilizes biological systems, living organisms or parts of this to develop or create different products.</li>
<li>Brewing and baking bread are examples of processes that fall within the concept of biotechnology (use of yeast (= living organism) to produce the desired product).  <ul>
<li>Such traditional processes usually utilize the living organisms in their natural form (or further developed by breeding), while the more modern form of biotechnology will generally involve a more advanced modification of the biological system or organism.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>With the development of genetic engineering in the 1970s, research in biotechnology (and other related areas such as medicine, biology etc.) developed rapidly because of the new possibility to make changes in the organisms' genetic material (DNA).</li>
<li>Biotechnology deals with industrial scale production of biopharmaceuticals and biologicals using genetically modified microbes, fungi, plants and animals.</li>
<li>The applications of biotechnology include therapeutics, diagnostics, genetically modified crops for agriculture, processed food, bioremediation, waste treatment, and energy production.</li>
