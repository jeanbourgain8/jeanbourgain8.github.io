<hr>
<p>Though it's a thriller, too much of the suspense was stacked to the end, hoping to surprise with very little to conceive. <br>
Mr. Mason comes as the usual demigod pulling clever tricks - reverse playing the games of DA and making him the fool, also on Halstead. <br>
In the middle, the author tricks the avg. man (atleast I got) to assume that Lorraine was an accomplice in murder committed by Royden, deceiving us with a spell of romance.<br>
All in All, I would say , the book wasn't very engaging but it's not very dissapointing either.<br>
Perry Mason seldom dissapoints me.  </p>
