<hr>
<p>An informed reader would already know that the author's disposition is unconventional in this book. </p>
<p>In this he tries to dismantle the usual emphasis laid on virtues, as to him, they appear too distant from reality &amp; handicapped when it comes to getting things done. He treats both virtues &amp; vices with equanimity. His core agenda appears to be this - "<strong>doing whatever it takes to retain the kingship</strong>". Depending on the environment, situations &amp; resources available, he puts forward necessary strategies which are to be adopted. On whole, it is a guide which addresses all significant stages one comes across in the cycle of kingship.</p>
<p>I consider this as an insightful read. I shall not think twice if I wish to read it again. </p>
