<p>I'm Hasanth, I graduated from IIT-Kharagpur with a Bachelors in Instrumentation Engg. (Dept. of Electrical Engg.) in 2016 and worked as a Software Engineer - II for one year at Hewlett Packard Enterprise - R&amp;D between 2016-17 (resigned). In <strong>June 2019</strong>, I was supposed to join <strong>University at Buffalo / University of Texas at Dallas (with scholarship) for my Masters in CS</strong>, but due to some personal reasons I've dropped my plan and been preparing and appeared for UPSC-Civil Services Exam (CSE), with <strong>Maths as my optional</strong> subject (<a href="https://byjus.com/free-ias-prep/ias-mathematics-syllabus/">Syllabus</a> includes B.Sc/M.Sc level subjects - <strong>Real Analysis, Algebra, ODEs &amp; PDEs, Mathematical Physics - Fluid Dynamics, Linear Programming etc.</strong>). <br>
Last year in <strong>Sept'22,</strong> I gave my UPSC-Mains (Stage-II) exam after clearing the Prelims but unfortunately couldn't make it to the final list. <br>
Prior to this, I was interested in Theoretical CS with an inclination towards Economics, especially I was looking forward to working with Siddharth Barman (Fair Division etc.) at IISC down the line in future. After changing the plan to pursue UPSC, I made a decision to delay my PhD pursuit for 5-7 years after joining the service (which the govt. allows).<br>
But it was only in the last <strong>Oct'22</strong>, I came across similar lines of research being done by <strong>You &amp; Prof. Sourav Roy at ISI-Kolkata,  Prof. Debasis Mishra &amp; Prof. Arunava Sen at ISI-Delhi etc.,</strong> but from an Economics standpoint. In my search, <strong>I've also found that there exists an opportunity of pursuing a part-time PhD at ISI-Kolkata/Delhi &amp; IITs - Kanpur, Delhi etc.,</strong> which has got me very excited and made me revive my plan to pursue PhD.</p>
<p>In this regard, while continuing my preparation for UPSC-CSE to appear in 2023 (<strong>Prelims - May'23, Mains - Sept'23</strong>), I've also started to pick up the basics of Economics from <strong>Oct'22</strong> with the help of M.A. Economics at IGNOU (as I could get a M.A. degree remotely) and gave my 1st year exams in <strong>Dec'22-Jan'23</strong>. But UPSC-CSE exam being extremely demanding in memory and time, I'm unable to complete the foundations required well within the time to appear for ISI-JRF(QE) exam being held in <strong>May'23</strong>, especially reading Macro, Econometrics etc., appears more than my interests for now due my time being constrained. UPSC-Prelims is also being conducted in the same month as ISI-JRF (QE). As <strong>I'm aiming to secure a top rank in the final list without a compromise</strong>, <strong>I have decided to go back on ISI-JRF (QE) searching for alternatives which would allow me to take an admission in a part-time PhD program starting from Sept'23,</strong> as soon as I finish with my UPSC-CSE(Mains) exam. <br>
By this, I will also get more than enough time to concretely build my foundations in Economic Theory. <strong>Above all, this would provide me enough time to read some papers and also pick up the trending research directions in the subjects - Mechanism Design, Game Theory, Choice &amp; Decision Theory etc.</strong>.  </p>
<p><strong>How will a part-time PhD benefit me, as I will be joining Civil Services ?</strong><br>
I will be choosing <strong>Indian Foreign Service</strong> as my first cadre preference, where working in strategic environments happens to be the core aspect of the job. Even though the work may not be directly related to the research work I wish to do in (<strong>Mechanism Design, Game Theory,  Choice, Decision Theory etc.</strong> <strong>primarily</strong>, if possible some other areas in Maths &amp; TCS as well), it would provide enough on ground insights which can be aligned with above research topics. Also, a PhD work relating to such strategic analysis would make me a front runner in leading either the Economics/Political Wings within the Indian Foreign Service. <strong>By pursuing part-time while being in the service, I shall be secure and not have to worry about career &amp; family etc. much, and can pursue research whole-heartedly with dedication.</strong> </p>
<p><strong>As I will be joining the service (IFS) in Aug'24, I would only seek assistance or fellowship for the period Sept'23 to Aug'24, after that other than access to journals, travel grants and book-purchases, I won't be needing any kind of monetary assistance for my part-time PhD pursuit.</strong>  </p>
<p>Finally, to conclude, I've always been a theory enthusiast starting from my Bachelors (when working for my thesis identifying <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hmHOy27Xk3FgPk-aof9BHi59bLE3XmL4/view">mistakes</a> in the algorithm of an IEEE-TPAMI <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6891337">Paper</a> -  A<em> rating ML Theory Journal in 2015-16 (now NeurIPS)), till today in the intersection of </em><em>Maths, Theoretical CS &amp; Economics etc.</em>* areas, pursuing a PhD was always part of my plan, it was only the matter of time (when) that has changed.</p>
