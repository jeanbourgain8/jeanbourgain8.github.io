<h2 id="2-introduction">2. Introduction</h2>
<p>To my fortune, I have found a great <strong>possibility</strong> in <strong>Sept'2022</strong>, which was the same month in which I gave my UPSC-CSE (Mains) Exam. The <strong>possibility</strong> has profoundly excited me to an extent that I was even ready to deliberately flunk my exam (only to appear again in next year - 2023). Till then, I have half-heartedly accepted &amp; planned to delay my research pursuit for 5-7 years to comply with the rules of govt. (min. time one should spend in service to obtain a study leave), but this discovery of a <strong>possibility</strong> has <strong>rekindled</strong> my spirit to pursue research without having to delay it any further. Prior to this, my actual plan was to appear in UPSC-CSE (for IAS/IFS), finish my M.A. Economics at IGNOU so that I can appear for Indian Economic Services as a backup option.<br>
Naturally, it might occur to you when I'm so interested in research with much many opportunities existing today, be it at Google/Microsoft/Amazon Research and many other MNCs to work on Electronic Commerce/Algos/Networks etc. </p>
<p><strong>"Why don't I pursue research single-mindedly and become a Research Scientist/Professor ? "</strong> </p>
<p>In 2019 (Jun), I have made a steadfast decision to work for the state (govt.) as an organisation in an administrative position be it either in Administrative/Foreign Services and pursue research as a <strong>habit</strong> (<strong>not as a hobby</strong>; but with dedication). Also, the fact that I find it very hard &amp; contrasting to my personality, to dedicate myself to one particular area/subject for an extended period of time (&gt;15+ yrs) has completely ruled out the option of even thinking to become a full-time professor for me. That's why, to work for the state in an administrative capacity &amp; also to retain felixibility in my breadth of interests - Maths, Theoretical CS &amp; Economics etc., I have chosen this particular path.   </p>
<h2 id="3-theoretical-economics-succcurlyeq-theoretical-cs">3. Theoretical Economics $\succcurlyeq$ Theoretical CS</h2>
<p>I have observed that ISI-Delhi provides an opportunity although it doesn't recommended yet it is open to a possibility for one to pursue their PhD remotely (not as a full-time). In my enquiry, I have come to know that there are people who are pursuing/have pursued research part-time (Ex: Leena Kumar etc.). Now, this possibility has come as an absolute blessing to me. I do not have to wait/delay my plan of pursuing research any further for 5-7 years.   </p>
<p>After spending some time working on projects till Jun'2019 in resolving the dilemma of my future pursuit between Theory &amp; Applied aspects of Machine Learning, I have realised that my inclincation was more towards Theory. Since then, I've been exploring (briefly) theory in different areas apart from Machine Learning within the computer science (Algorithmic Game Theory, Approximation Algos, Graph Theory &amp; Combinatorics etc.) keeping myself updated with the directions of happening research works.

Recently, after re-aligning my interests with Economics as primary focus from Theoretical CS in Sept'22,  <strong>I have found ISI-Delhi with You &amp; Prof. Arunava Sen as crown jewels to my this new world</strong>. Adding to it, "<ins><strong>the possibility of pursuing research remotely</strong></ins>" has only made the feeling even more concrete. </p>
<p>In this regard, from Oct'22 I have started to pickup the basics of the subjects with the help of M.A. Economics course at IGNOU. I felt it was the best option to pursue, simultaneously could also earn a degree. If in case, not even in my wildest dreams I would allow, but if anything goes wrong with the UPSC-CSE, I can appear for Indian Economic Services ( for which M.A. Economics is compulsory) as a backup option. </p>
<h2 id="4-need-some-more-time">4. Need some more Time!</h2>
<p>Though the ISI-JRF (QE) exam primarily focuses on foundational depth with some deducable patterns existing in the questions asked - Utility Maximization, Theory of Choice, Econometrics Basics + Dev Econ., Time Series Basics, Growth Models, Nash &amp; Sub-Perfect Nash Equilibrium (one year they were missing). I came across some instances where the terminologies appearing in the exam which are not quite common at the first instance for someone like me who just started in Oct'22 (Ex: $2^{nd}$ Question's Perfect Labour Mobility in QEB, 2018 etc.) .</p>
<p>If not for both ISI-JRF &amp; IGNOU exams, I would have strictly confined myself to Microeconomic Theory and covered as much material as possible restricting exclusively to the following topics at first - <strong>Theory of Choice, Equilibrium &amp; Welfare, Game Theory, Mechanism Design, Auction Theory etc.</strong>, starting with your notes for the foundations build up.<br>
But lately, I'm having a feeling that I will need some extra time inorder to cover these  more broadly &amp; concretely, especially with UPSC-CSE preparation heavily constraing my time. And also to fill my knowledge gaps in Econometrics (despite familiarity with Max. Likelihood, Regression etc. in Machine Learning) &amp; Macroeconomic Theory (being broad). I may have completed 1st year M.A. Economics - IGNOU exams already in Dec'22, but I did not find their materials sufficient enough to cover the breadth &amp; depth required. I found them a lot more verbose.

<summary>[Click to Expand] <strong>Clash of UPSC - CSE, ISI-JRF (QE), Indian Economic Services, 2nd year M.A. Economics - IGNOU Exams </strong></summary>
<br>
UPSC-CSE being primarily a memory-based exam and me aiming for securing a top-rank in it, a major portion of my day-time gets consumed by it, in addition its Mathematics Syllabus is more wider than deeper (almost equivalent to M.Sc Level). If it is not for Mathematics & its vast syllabus (advantage is fetches more marks), UPSC-CSE would have been much easier to be done away with.
All of the exams happening around the same months is making it quite difficult for me to optimally allocate my attention & memory to obtain the best results in all. To my luck/bad-luck 2nd year M.A. Economics exams of IGNOU and Indian Economic Services are clashing with the exam dates, preparation for these two has been demanding a lot of my head memory more than others, both of them are verbose. <br>
So, for their sheer size in material and also clashing of dates, I have decided not to appear for Indian Economic Services Exam this year & postponed my plan to give my 2nd year M.A. Economics exams of IGNOU to Dec'2023. <br>
With this, only two exams remain - UPSC-CSE (Prelims in May'23 & Mains in Sept'23) & ISI-JRF (in May'23) to tackle currently, yet both being in May'2023 (UPSC - Prelims) with contrasting demands of the subjects, especially memory management which is heaviy required for UPSC-CSE. In addition to this, QEA of ISI-JRF (QE) requires Probability & Statistics, Optimization etc. (though not very deeply), UPSC-CSE (Maths) held in Sept'23 demands primary focus on ODEs, PDEs, Mathematical Physics - Mechanics, Fluid Dynamics, Group Theory, Real Analysis etc., with only Linear Algebra & Calculus being common to both.
<br>
</details>
<p><br>
All in All, despite cutting down the number of exams to appear in to two, both UPSC-CSE &amp; ISI-JRF are being quite demanding in subjects breadth within less time, it has become quite difficult for me to memory manage &amp; work towards producing best results in both, especially when preparing without any established guidance. To address this problem, I have found a solution but I would like to check them with you and verify before I proceed. </p>

<p><strong>Instead of appearing for the exam in May'23 and joining the campus in Aug'23, Can I instead seek admission starting from Sept'23 for the PhD Program?</strong> I'm ready to take any kind of examination which the admission board demands from me - written/interview etc.
 <br>
<details>
   <summary>[Click to Expand] <strong>Explanation:</strong></summary>
   Since, it is being difficult to memory manage for both exams UPSC-CSE & ISI-JRF being held in May'23. In this regard, taking note of the exception that exists on ISI's - Economics Planning Unit webpage attached above. Can I seek an admission instead by taking the examination test the admission board requires me to start from Sept'23 ? <br>

   <p><img src="/images/JRF%20Webpage.png"></img></p><br>
   By doing this, I can provide maximum attention <strong>towards securing a top-rank in UPSC-CSE</strong> with its written exams finishing in Sept'23. Also, this would provide me more than enough time (since I have only started in Oct'22) to concretely establish my foundations strongly in Micro Theory - Choice, Equilibrium  & Welfare, Game Theory, Mechanism Design,  Auctions & Network Theory. Additionally, this will also provide me enough time to fill my knowledge gaps in Econometrics & Macro Theory (based on micro elements) lot more beyond the demands of the ISI-JRF Exam. <br>
   Above all, this will provide me enough time to do an in-depth analysis on some recent papers and understand the trends and directions of research more concretely. 
   By getting done away with UPSC-CSE (securing a top-rank), I can whole-heartedly be able to dedicate myself to research without having to worry about career and family much.

<p><strong>Is ISI-JRF (QE) exam the only way to join the PhD program with a fellowship ? Will I be eligible for JRF Fellowship for starting from Sept'23 ? Otherwise, Can I begin my PhD program with your SERB CRG grant for the period Sept'23 - Jul'24 mentioned on Economic Planning Unit's (EPU) webpage and clear the exam in May'2024 for JRF Fellowship ?</strong> 
 <br>
<details>
   <summary>[Click to Expand] <strong>Explanation:</strong></summary>
   According to the instructions mentioned on the EPU's PhD program webpage, I will probably be ineligible for JRF Fellowship untill I clear the exam in the following year (2024) since I'm planning to take admission in PhD program starting from Sept'23. In this regard, I would like to know whether after clearing the test with admission board will you be able to offer me fellowship from SERB CRG grant in equivalent terms as mentioned on EPU's Announcements webpage, attached below.<br>

<p>I started my research pursuit with <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1baLe5P9N5wIfxbIhuJDW9uw_jOTpaQQU/view?usp=sharing">Bio-Medical Devices &amp; Imaging</a>, <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IwRRM0X6Xsn-6FphBChUmscy894OCHYl/view">Instrumentation</a> and have walked a long path experimenting in different areas - <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LS3Y6dzPuQ-YZN2ZHMHlZPWwNeGkSEyo/view?usp=sharing">Machine Learning</a> (<a href="https://github.com/anhttran/3dmm_cnn">Applied</a> <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1y33JUi8W0MT1X8cHpywhF-WbSSGmsKKO?usp=sharing">&amp;</a> <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hmHOy27Xk3FgPk-aof9BHi59bLE3XmL4/view">Theory</a>), <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.00523v1.pdf">3D</a> <a href="https://flame.is.tue.mpg.de/">Face</a>, <a href="https://smpl-x.is.tue.mpg.de/">Body</a> <a href="https://grail.cs.washington.edu/projects/AudioToObama/">Reconstruction</a>, SLAM (typically called as <a href="https://grail.cs.washington.edu/projects/personnerf/">NERFs</a> recently) etc. where some happened to be co-incidental (includes job at HPE) with the trends and others well thought ones (exploring Theory). For this, I do believe that my graduation course is also partly responsible where unlike other core branches such as EE, ECE, CS etc., Instrumentation Engg. curriculum at IIT-KGP happens to be a mix of all three with little specific to Instrumentation, limited by its extent of applications. It was only in 2019 (mid) I have concretely realized that my interests primarily lie in the intersection of Maths, Theoretical CS &amp; Economics subjects, and resolved to pursue research for the coming next 10-15 years in these fields. I was supposed to join in one of Masters CS programs starting from June'2019 but for some specific reasons, and also having realized by then already that I like Theory a lot more than the Applied aspects of research, I have dropped my masters plan abroad (avoiding to spend any sums) and chose the path of Civil Services with a plan to do a PhD down the line after 5-7 years being in the service (which is allowed complying with the rules). Till then, I actually planned to pursue research independently more as a habit and enter into a PhD program in future with problems identified well beforehand to work upon.</p>
