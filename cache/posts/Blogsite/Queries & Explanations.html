<p><strong>Instead of appearing for the exam in May'23 and joining the campus in Aug'23, Can I instead seek an admission starting from Sept'23 for the PhD Program?</strong> 
 <br>
<details>
   <summary>[Click to Expand] <strong>Explanation:</strong></summary>
   Since, it is being difficult to deal with my memory for both UPSC-CSE (Prelims) & ISI-JRF exams being held in the same month (May'23), taking note of the exception that exists on ISI's - Economics Planning Unit webpage attached below. <br>
   Can I seek an admission by taking the examination whichever the admission board requires me, to start from Sept'23 - written/interview/both etc. ? <br>

   <p><img src="/images/JRF%20Webpage.png"></img></p><br>
   By doing this, I can provide maximum attention <strong>towards securing a top-rank in UPSC-CSE</strong> at first and finish off the written exams (UPSC - CSE (Mains)) by Sept'23.This would also provide me more than enough time (since I have started picking up Economics only from Oct'22) to concretely establish my foundations strongly in <strong>Micro Theory - Choice, Equilibrium  & Welfare, Game Theory, Mechanism Design,  Auctions & Network Theory etc.,</strong> and fill my knowledge gaps in Econometrics & Macro Theory (emphasising on parts involving micro elements) a lot more beyond the demand levels of the ISI-JRF Exam. <br>
   Above all, I get to have enough time to do an in-depth analysis on some recent papers and understand the trends and directions of research more concretely. 
   By getting done away with UPSC-CSE exam (securing a top-rank), I can whole-heartedly dedicate myself to research without having to worry about career planning and family at home much.

<p><strong>Is ISI-JRF (QE) exam the only way to join the PhD program with a fellowship ? Will I be offered JRF Fellowship for starting from Sept'23 ? Otherwise, Can I begin my PhD program with your SERB CRG grant for the period Sept'23 - Jul'24 as mentioned on Economic Planning Unit's (EPU) webpage and clear the exam next year in May'2024 for JRF Fellowship ?</strong> 
 <br>

   Going by the instructions mentioned on the EPU's PhD program webpage, I will probably be ineligible for JRF Fellowship until I clear the exam in the next year (2024), <strong>as I'm planning to get my admission in PhD program starting from Sept'23</strong>. In this regard, I would like to know whether after clearing the test with admission board will you be able to offer me fellowship in equivalent terms, from your SERB CRG grant as mentioned on EPU's Announcements webpage, attached below.<br>

   Also to mention, even after clearing the exam next year (May'24), as I will be joining the services (IFS/IAS/IES), starting from Aug'24 I will not require assistance from JRF Fellowship, except for travel grants, book-purchases, journal access etc.

<p><strong>As I will be joining almost by the end of Sept'23, will I be allowed to directly appear for the 1st Semester Term-End Exams or will there be any clauses for missing the Mid-Terms in the 1st Semester ? Is there a way in which I can compensate for them by giving my Mid-Terms seperately after joining at the end of Sept'23 ?</strong> 
 <br>
<details>
   <summary>[Click to Expand] <strong>Explanation:</strong></summary>
   I will oblige to the conditions which authorities shall seek from me to compensate for the mid-terms.   <br>
   Since, joining at the end of Sept'23 will provide me good enough time, I will by default finish off reading the standard references related to the courses taught in the 1st semester, except the seminar courses before taking the admission in Sept'23. For a quick reference, I have created a list of <a href="https://jeanbourgain8.github.io/posts/Blogsite/2023-03-05-05%3A43%3A56/">resources</a> for you to verify and suggest any additions or corrections which you think are necessary. Thanks!
