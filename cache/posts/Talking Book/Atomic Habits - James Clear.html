<li>I've seen the book circling as recommendation by &amp; to business, management folks, as of now, I'm skeptical about the chances of learning something new, insightful which I had never thought of, </li>
<li>I'm on 26th page, till here it's been pale, my opinion signifies that the author probably must've been concerned about filling himself. </li>
<li>I'll be waiting for the next day to come, for me to continue reading the book</li>
