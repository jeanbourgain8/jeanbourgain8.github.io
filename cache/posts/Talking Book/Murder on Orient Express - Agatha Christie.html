<li>As of now, it's 8:20 pm, I'm on 52th page of the book. Before starting my read, my involuntarily set objectives were to know the following : 
    1) What is that makes the author so famous ?
    2) My experience with mystery got piqued after reading a couple of books from Perry Mason Collection, now, for a change I wanted to see how other named authors works would be, so, I picked one of Agatha Christie's
    3) What all insights I should pick from the readings ? 
    4) Can the detective in this beat out Perry Mason's ? </li>
</ul>
<p>So far, the book's been okayish, till now I see only environment setting-up happening, slipping into the core plot seems just started, I'm excited to check Poirot's abilities. The grammar &amp; style of words seems very untimely (or) sophisticated enough for me to doubt it. </p>
