<h2 id="book-review">Book Review</h2>
<hr>
<p>As an avg. reader would already be aware that the author's disposition is unconventional in this book. </p>
<p>He tries to dismantle the usual emphasis laid on virtues, as to him, they appear too distant from reality &amp; handicapped when it comes to getting things done. He treats both virtues &amp; vices in equanimity, where the core ideology appears to be this - "doing whatever it takes to retain the kingship". He depending on the environments &amp; weights of different situations, resources, put forwards necessary strategies which are to be adopted. It is a compendium &amp; addresses all significant stages in the cycle of kingship.</p>
<p>I surely consider this as an insightful read &amp; whenever necessary I would never forget/think twice to get back to reading it again. </p>
