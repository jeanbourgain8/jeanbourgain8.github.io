<li>Ability to reason is what makes a man different from animal</li>
<li>Every action &amp; thought is supposed to be questioned for it's cause/origin , objective and it's compliance with the present instant of time &amp; efficacy with which it is being carried upon</li>

<li>Guiding the conscious through towards the desired goals with an intention in becoming unison with the unconscious to experience the truth.</li>
<li>Attention is a prime tool which helps in operating the mental activity efficaciously. The ability to control the unconscious resides in temperately handling the attention of conscious actions. One which is given more attention will more likely have the unconscious attended. Unconscious is a great instrument in coming up with thoughts that err from normality.</li>
<li>Not in any world shall one let have his control in the hands of others. It's a very strict no. It clearly means that you are handing over your life to someone and asking them to lead it by their wishes. It's sure that you will repent for doing it.</li>
