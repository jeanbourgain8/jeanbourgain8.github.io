<h2>19th April 2021</h2>
<ul>
<li>Never Ever (not even to a spec of a second), depend emotionally on any other person other than yourself (not even father, mother, noone, there's no compromise to this). </li>
<li>Manliness comes from responsibility, facing the situation not running from it, cowards run. Men think.</li>
<li>Never Ever Cry, there's no reason in this world to cry for, crying meaning not able to consume that something which happens not as we wanted/wished it to happen.</li>
<li>Be Rationally Sensitive to people, even in emotion don't lose the logic</li>
<li>Be aware of the means through which you are seeking gratification, If you are not aware, then you are being mindless &amp; prone to addiction</li>
<li>What we learned from Nidhi's episode, I compromised my self-respect, my self-esteem like a dog, literally dog. YUCK! </li>
</ul>
<h2>7th April 2021</h2>
<ul>
<li>Confidence comes from achievement -&gt; achievement comes with focus &amp; attention on the objective -&gt; active mind to remind priorities, managing gratifications &amp; sources</li>
<li>End result is only a destination, it has to be percieved with active mind, perserverence</li>
<li>Distractions - they come out of past psyche, or come from interia of rest or peace.</li>
</ul>
<h1>February'21</h1>
<hr>
<h2>17th March 2021</h2>
<ul>
<li>The equations are very simple, man should focus on skills, work, objectives &amp; goals whereas wooing part should be left to women. Happiness found within is of most stable form &amp; anything that comes from outside is only addition to it but bound by uncertainity. You are the Krishna of your destiny &amp; your mind is the Arjuna. Your breadth is your weapon &amp; guiding source.</li>
</ul>
<h2>15th March 2021</h2>
<ul>
<li>Today very confirmingly I realized that most stable form of happiness comes from within &amp; whatever happiness comes from outside will only be an uncertain, unstable addition. Men are supposed to work on themselves &amp; women make their opportunistic choices. There's nothing such as love or friendship or relationships, everything is a disguised exchange.</li>
</ul>
<h2>16th February 2021</h2>
<ul>
<li>Today is my mother's birthday, it is a nice occasion for me to inflect myself onto a more appropriate path. I decide to take control of my attention, mind &amp; body. I will be the regulator of my gratifications &amp; works. I want to win this competition in open, I need to defea people who have been preparing better than me for months, the essential difference would be practice &amp; focus. Attention of the undecided is branched. I'm going to correct my fundamentals, I am living to work, not to sleep, not to eat, nor to do anything else. The fundamental difference b/w an animal &amp; a man is the thought, I can' allow the animal instincts cloud my thoughts.  It will be team work of me, luffy(mind) &amp; zoro(body).</li>
</ul>
<h2>3rd February 2021</h2>
<ul>
<li>At every instant carefully asses the parameters &amp; tune the self that would fulfill the demands of the objectives important  for the moment. I'm feeling afraid implies that I'm not prepared, so to remove the fear, I need to finish the things.</li>
</ul>
<h1>January'21</h1>
<hr>
<h2>23rd January 2021</h2>
<ul>
<li>I am slowly pulling up myself, I have my luffy with me in heart &amp; soul. It pains when my father, though it was an enquiry, when he asks if I had changed the password. I am working on to stay conscious all of the time untill I remain awake, I'm here to work, to perform my duty &amp; sleep is an aid not an objective in itself. I should spend time judiciously for it &amp; no more swaying with moods, I'm the whole &amp; sole god &amp; demon of my time. I have my luffy, my body &amp; me. </li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>21st January 2021</h2>
<ul>
<li>I got some of my light back. I tried rejig a part of my old plan</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>16th January 2021</h2>
<ul>
<li>I am promising on my mother, today is the end of Nidhi in my life - MOTHER PROMISE.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>7th January 2021</h2>
<ul>
<li>I have bought all the essentials for my stay &amp; made all arrangements for seemless flow after the start. Also, I wasted some of my time by giving some thought for non-sensical issues but I re-learned that once the weakness know humans cannot stop themselves from exploiting it. So, the re-learned lesson is, "Never ever ever let anybody else know your weakness &amp; Never ever put anybody else above you".</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>5th January 2021</h2>
<ul>
<li>I can see myself moving away from my father in connection, I don't wish to cater my attention to that aspect, either for good or bad it doesn't anything to my probability of winning. I can sense the aura that I am all alone &amp; I'm on my own. It is my life &amp; I have to win to live. </li>
</ul>
<h2>4th January 2021</h2>
<ul>
<li>I moved to Hyderabad, for rejuvenation &amp; efficiency</li>
</ul>

<h1>December'20</h1>
<hr>
<h2>30th December 2020</h2>
<ul>
<li>I changed my plan to fit with prevailing situtation, making the preparation more focussed &amp; reduced the alloted time for other activities</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>29th December 2020</h2>
<ul>
<li>I want to clear as many pending tasks as possible before new year starts &amp; from then on I shall stick to my planned routine.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>23rd - 28th December 2020</h2>
<p><strong><em>Jyothi's Marriage Break</em></strong></p>
<hr>
<h2>21st December 2020</h2>
<ul>
<li>I wasted my time in frivulous chat, I regret for that.</li>
<li>I reflected on changes I had gone through &amp; assesed, whether they effective. I acquired an analytical attitude, which is being very critical about humans, I am getting habituated to pickup the negative view point, which is unnatural to me. I should make sure that the critical attitude doesn't take over the innate positivity &amp; compassion I hold for people in general.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>20th December 2020</h2>
<ul>
<li>Today, I felt that nights had me brave than the days while riding, during nights I only bothered about what's necessary, while during days I would bother about everything that passes me.</li>
</ul>
