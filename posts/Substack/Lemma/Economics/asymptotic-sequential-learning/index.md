<!-- TEASER_END -->

In brief, this paper[^1] tries to focus on the convergance rate and its dependencies on actions and signals. They try to prove that the convergence occurs quickly with respect to signals' *external observations* rather than actions using a two state stochastic process. Taking the case of Gaussian distribution as the signal distribution they prove that the convergence with respect to actions occurs by $(\sqrt{\log t})$ times faster. They also discuss the definitivity of the convergence placing an emphasis on the sublinerity of the actions' influence. 

**Note:** Sublinearity means $(\lim\limits_{n \to \infty} \frac{x_n}{n})$
