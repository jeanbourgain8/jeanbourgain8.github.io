<h2 id="need-some-extra-time">Need some extra time</h2>
<p>In this regard, to join the PhD program at ISI-Delhi,  from Oct'22 I have started working towards picking up basics of the subjects with the help of M.A. Economics course at IGNOU. I felt it was the best option available for me to pursue remotely, simultaneously I would also earn a degree. If in case, not even in my wildest dreams I would allow, but if anything goes wrong with the UPSC-CSE, I can appear for Indian Economic Services ( for which M.A. Economics is compulsory) as a backup option. </p>
<p>Though the ISI-JRF (QE) exam primarily focuses on foundational depth with some deducable patterns existing in the questions asked - Utility Maximization, Theory of Choice, Econometrics Basics + Dev Econ., Time Series Basics, Growth Models, Nash &amp; Sub-Perfect Nash Equilibrium (one year they were missing). I came across some instances where the terminologies appearing in the exam which are not quite common at the first instance for someone like me who just got started in Oct'22 (Ex: $2^{nd}$ Question's Perfect Labour Mobility in QEB, 2018 etc.) .</p>
<p>If not for both ISI-JRF &amp; IGNOU exams, I would have strictly confined myself to Microeconomic Theory and covered as much material as possible restricting exclusively to the following topics at first - <strong>Theory of Choice, Equilibrium &amp; Welfare, Game Theory, Mechanism Design, Auction Theory etc.</strong>, starting with your notes for the foundations build up.<br>
But lately, I'm having a feeling that I will need some extra time inorder to cover these topics more extensively &amp; concretely, especially with UPSC-CSE preparation heavily constraing my time. Also to fill my knowledge gaps in Econometrics (despite my prior familiarity with Max. Likelihood, Regression etc. in Machine Learning) &amp; Macroeconomic Theory (being broad in subject). I may have completed 1st year M.A. Economics - IGNOU exams already in Dec'22-Jan'23, but I did not find their materials sufficient enough to cover the breadth &amp; depth needed. I found them a lot more verbose.
<br></p>
<details><summary>[Click to Expand] <strong>Clash of UPSC - CSE, ISI-JRF (QE), Indian Economic Services, 2nd year M.A. Economics - IGNOU Exams </strong></summary><br>
UPSC-CSE being primarily a memory-based exam and me aiming for securing a top-rank in it, a major portion of my day-time gets consumed by it, in addition its Mathematics Syllabus is more wider than deeper (almost equivalent to M.Sc Level). If it is not for Mathematics &amp; its vast syllabus (advantage is fetches more marks), UPSC-CSE would have been much easier to be done away with.
All of the exams happening around the same months is making it quite difficult for me to optimally allocate my attention &amp; memory to obtain the best results in all. To my luck/bad-luck 2nd year M.A. Economics exams of IGNOU and Indian Economic Services are clashing with the exam dates, preparation for these two has been demanding a lot of my head memory more than others, both of them are verbose. <br>
So, for their sheer size in material and also clashing of dates, I have decided not to appear for Indian Economic Services Exam this year &amp; postponed my plan to give my 2nd year M.A. Economics exams of IGNOU to Dec'2023. <br>
With this, only two exams remain - UPSC-CSE (Prelims in May'23 &amp; Mains in Sept'23) &amp; ISI-JRF (in May'23) to tackle currently, yet both being in May'2023 (UPSC - Prelims) with contrasting demands of the subjects, especially memory management which is heaviy required for UPSC-CSE. In addition to this, QEA of ISI-JRF (QE) requires Probability &amp; Statistics, Optimization etc. (though not very deeply), UPSC-CSE (Maths) held in Sept'23 demands primary focus on ODEs, PDEs, Mathematical Physics - Mechanics, Fluid Dynamics, Group Theory, Real Analysis etc., with only Linear Algebra &amp; Calculus being common to both.

</p>
<p><br>
All in All, despite cutting down the number of exams (UPSC-CSE, ISI-JRF, UPSC-IES, 2nd yr @ M.A. - IGNOU) to appear in to two, both UPSC-CSE &amp; ISI-JRF are being quite demanding in subjects breadth within this very less time, it has become quite difficult for me to memory manage &amp; work towards producing best results in both, especially to secure a top rank in UPSC-CSE when preparing without any established guidance. To address this problem, I have found a solution but I wanted to check them with you and verify before I proceed. So, I have made a blog post mentioning them <a href="Blogsite/2023-03-05-05%3A47%3A55/">here</a>. Please Check.</p>

<hr>
<h3 id="1-introduction">1. Introduction</h3>
<p>To my fortune, I have found a great <strong>possibility</strong> in <strong>Sept'2022</strong>, which was the same month in which I gave my UPSC-CSE (Mains) Exam in 2022. The <strong>possibility</strong> has profoundly excited me to an extent that I was even ready to deliberately flunk my exam (only to appear again in next year - 2023). Till then, I have half-heartedly accepted &amp; planned to delay my research pursuit for 5-7 years to comply with the rules of govt. (min. time one should spend in the service to obtain a study leave), but this discovery of a <strong>possibility</strong> has <strong>rekindled</strong> my spirit to pursue research without having to delay it any further. <br>
Prior to this discovery, my original plan was to appear in UPSC-CSE (for IAS/IFS), finish my M.A. Economics at IGNOU so that I can appear for Indian Economic Services as a backup option.  </p>
<p>Now, naturally it might occur to you when I'm so interested in research with so many opportunities existing today, be it at Google/Microsoft/Amazon Research and many other MNCs to work on Electronic Commerce/Algos/Networks etc. </p>
<p><strong>Why don't I pursue research single-mindedly and become a Research Scientist/Professor ?</strong></p>
<p>In Jun'2019, I have made a steadfast decision to work for the state (govt.) as an organisation in an administrative position be it either in Administrative/Foreign Services and pursue research as a <strong>habit</strong> (<strong>not as a hobby</strong>; but <strong>with dedication</strong>). Also, the fact that I find it very hard &amp; contrasting to my personality, to dedicate myself to one particular area/subject for an extended period of time (&gt;15+ yrs) has completely ruled out the option for me to even think of becoming a full-time professor. That's why, to work for the state in an administrative capacity &amp; also to retain felixibility in my breadth of interests - Maths, Theoretical CS &amp; Economics etc., I have chosen this particular path - Civil Services + Research (as a habit).</p>
<h3 id="2-why-isi-delhi">2. Why ISI-Delhi ?</h3>
<p>I have observed that ISI-Delhi provides an unique opportunity, though not recommended, it is open to a possibility for people to pursue their PhD remotely (not full-time). In my enquiry, I have come to know that there are people who are pursuing/have pursued research <strong>part-time</strong> (Ex: Leena Kumar etc.). <strong>Now, this possibility has come as an absolute blessing to me</strong>. I do not have to wait/delay my plan of pursuing research any further for 5-7 years.   </p>
<p><em><strong>Note</strong>: By part-time I only mean to indicate the constraint of time but not its seriousness.</em></p>
<p>I believe that, doing a PhD at ISI would provide me an access to excellent research world community and equip me with tools and network in transforming myself succesfully into a Theoretical Economist. Also professionally, while working in the service (IFS), ISI being an Indian University would allow me to do a PhD simultaneously with minimal interference/restrictions from the govt. side. In every way, starting with You &amp; Prof. Arunava Sen, institute's quality of research, its norms and independence etc., for many such reasons, I cannot of think of any institute other than ISI -Delhi which can fit perfectly well with my aspirations. Hence, I named the title of this post as <strong>"My Tryst with ISI-Delhi"</strong>. </p>
<h3 id="3-why-prof-debasis-mishra">3. Why Prof. Debasis Mishra ?</h3>
<p>In my observation, Prof. Debasis Mishra as much an Microeconomic Theorist he is, I have found him also having some inclination towards theoretical aspects outside of economics, I have deduced this based on some of my observations such as, <strong>his research in Mechanism Design, Game Theory</strong> (Multi-Agents) areas (which always has influx of students from other fields, but, recently it is seeing an increasing influx of CS students), <strong>his stint at IISC-CSA after his PhD</strong>, <strong>his past association with Davic C. Parkes</strong> (positive signal) who is currently leading a group working on Economics &amp; Computation etc., <strong>a few more such observations  gaurentee me that I can flex/experiment ocassionally beyond Microeconomics during my PhD</strong>. In addition, while picking up economic analysis concepts from him, in exchange, I believe that I will bring new insights/ideas to the table due to some of my prior experience &amp; inclinations being in areas outside of economics, making it a win-win for both.</p>
<p>Also, the <strong>same alma</strong> mater adds a sense of security, especially in cases of any exigencies that may arise during my PhD (Ex: My current plan to take a delayed admission into the PhD program etc.).</p>
<p>For the above and many such reasons, I strongly feel that he will be a perfect advisor for me to succesfully transform into a Theoretical Economist. Added bonus is, I can also seek some guidance from Prof. Arunava Sen for choice concepts, which is why ISI-Delhi is simply the perfect fit for me. </p>
<h3 id="4-why-a-phd">4. Why a PhD ?</h3>
<p><strong>"Okay, shouldn't this be talked at first ?!"</strong>, <br><strong>Hmmm, Yes!</strong>, this is a reverse of usual order - <strong>Why ? Who ? Where ?</strong>   </p>
<p>As I have established above, I made a steadfast decision to become part of the either Administrative/Foreign services for some valid reasons in Jun'2019. But that doesn't mean I have to forgo my interest for research in theory, it was a compromise (half-heartedly done) I had to accept for the decisions I made. I accepted &amp; chose to delay my PhD for 5-7 years after getting into the service. </p>
<p>I guess, partly this half-hearted acceptance is also a reason for my delay in clearing the UPSC-CSE. I was unable to give my complete attention to the exam because I never felt getting into the services would complete me, rather I chose it because it would provide me an opportunity to formulate &amp; take decisions over problems concerning at large and also have a predictable future to pursue my interests independently.  </p>
<p>Since I started exploring theory in Jun'2019, I've been following works of some professors, a small subset I am mentioning here below.</p>
<h4 id="41-theoretical-economics-succcurlyeq-theoretical-cs">4.1 Theoretical Economics $\succcurlyeq$ Theoretical CS</h4>
<p>After spending some time working on projects till Jun'2019 to resolve the dilemma of my future pursuit between Theory &amp; Applied aspects of Machine Learning, I have realised that my inclination was more towards Theory. Since then, I've been exploring (briefly) theory in different areas apart from Machine Learning within the Computer Science (Algorithmic Game Theory, Approximation Algos, Graph Theory &amp; Combinatorics etc.), keeping myself updated with the new materials, directions and trends. </p>
<details><summary> [Click to Expand] <strong>Some professors I follow in Computer Science</strong></summary><br>
Prahlad Harsha &amp; Othrs. at TIFR, Siddharth Barman (Fair Division) at IISC &amp; groups working at Google &amp; Microsoft Research in India, U.Penn (Sampath Kannan), UW (Anna Karlin, Sebastien Bubeck, Yin-Tat-Lee etc.), UCSD (UIUC (Jugal Garg, Ruta Mehta etc.), Princeton (Matt Weinberg etc.), Harvard (Madhusudhan etc.), CMU (Pradeep Ravikumar, Venkatesh Guruswami etc.) and many other groups at MIT (Constantis Daskalias etc.), Columbia (Tim Roughgarden etc.), UW-Madison (Nowak, Suchi Chawla moved to UT-Austin etc.), Stanford (Andrea Montanari, etc.) &amp; people at many others places - UWaterloo, Toronto, Oxford, ETHZ, EPFL etc.
<br></details><p><br> 
Among them, I have found the research directions of Prof. Siddharth Barman at IISC interesting within India. So, I have put him at the top of my list to work with, if and when I plan to pursue PhD in future. Now, in <strong>Sept'22</strong> when I found that similar works are being done from Economics standpoint at ISI-Delhi, I felt very excited. In addition, the flexibility of ISI-Delhi program to work remotely has right away fixated me to it. All of a sudden, I re-configured all my career plans and revived my PhD plan, which earlier has been pushed down, to pursue it 5-7 years later. </p>
<p>Besides the quantitative emphasis in research at ISI-Delhi and convergence between my areas of interests with Prof. Debasis Mishra's works &amp; experience. After re-aligning my interests with Economics as primary focus from Theoretical CS in <strong>Sept'22</strong>,  <strong>I have found ISI-Delhi with You &amp; Prof. Arunava Sen as crown jewels to my this new world</strong>. Adding to this, "<ins><strong>the possibility of pursuing research remotely</strong></ins>" &amp; "<ins><strong>positive comments from students about Prof. Debasis Mishra's  mentorship</strong></ins>" has only made the feeling more concrete. </p>
<p>So yeah, PhD has always been part of the plan, it's just the matter of time that's changed.  </p>
<h3 id="5-how-will-a-phd-benefit-me">5. How will a PhD benefit me ?</h3>
<p>Now, I'll come to the cherry on top aspect of this entire PhD plan. While entering the UPSC-CSE journey, I wanted to become part of the Administrative Service (IAS) more than Foreign Service (IFS), but later after realising the demands of work beyond usual hours in the initials year of IAS, I was nudged to rethink my choice, because some personal time for me to pursue either science or other interests is non-negotiable to me, I feet that part of freedom is something hard for me to forgo. Yet, I've sticked to pursue IAS coming to a compromise that I can pursue reasearch after 5-7 years by taking a study leave. </p>
<p>But this discovery of a possibility to do a PhD at ISI-Delhi, has reinvigorated my spirit and changed all my plans. I changed my first preference to Foreign Services (IFS).  As far as I'm aware, the initial years though demand responsibility they aren't as demanding as in IAS, one will find enough time to pursue their interests while being in the service.</p>
<p><strong>The Cherry of this PhD Plan:</strong> The change of my primary area of research from Theoretical CS to Theoretical Economics - Mechanism Design, Game Theory, Choices, Auctions, Networks etc., all of these topics concern with the operations happening in strategic environments, which exactly is what happens to be my job as IFS. This convergence of my research and professional interests is a blessing to me. Also, by obtaining a PhD in Economics, I will by default get to lead the Economics Wing within the Foreign Services Divisions. </p>
<p><strong>Thus, in the end, my personal, professional &amp; all kinds of interests are converging altogether into one beautiful circle.</strong></p>
