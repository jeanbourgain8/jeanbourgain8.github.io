**Genetically modified [biopesticide](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-editorials/pesticide-management-in-india):** Bt toxin is produced by a bacterium called Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt for short).  

-   Bt toxin gene has been cloned from the bacteria and been expressed in plants to provide resistance to insects without the need for insecticides
-   In effect created a bio-pesticide. Examples are Bt cotton, Bt corn, rice, tomato, potato and soyabean etc. Bt Cotton.
