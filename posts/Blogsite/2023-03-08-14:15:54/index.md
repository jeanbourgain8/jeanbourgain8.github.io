I'm Hasanth, I graduated from IIT-Kharagpur with a Bachelors in Instrumentation Engg. (Dept. of Electrical Engg.) in 2016 and worked as a Software Engineer - II for one year at Hewlett Packard Enterprise - R&D between 2016-17 (resigned).   
In **June 2019**, I was supposed to join **University at Buffalo / University of Texas at Dallas (with scholarship) for my Masters in CS**, but due to some personal reasons I've dropped my plan and been preparing and appeared for UPSC-Civil Services Exam (CSE), with **Maths as my optional** subject ([Syllabus](https://byjus.com/free-ias-prep/ias-mathematics-syllabus/) includes B.Sc/M.Sc level subjects - **Real Analysis, Algebra, ODEs & PDEs, Mathematical Physics - Fluid Dynamics, Linear Programming etc.**).   

Last year in **Sept'22,** I gave my UPSC-Mains (Stage-II) exam after clearing the Prelims but unfortunately couldn't make it to the final list.   
Prior to this, I was interested in Theoretical CS with an inclination towards Economics, especially I was looking forward to working with Siddharth Barman (Fair Division etc.) at IISC down the line in future. After changing the plan to pursue UPSC, I made a decision to delay my PhD pursuit for 5-7 years after joining the service (which the govt. allows).  
But it was only in the last **Oct'22**, I came across similar lines of research being done by **You & Prof. Souvik Roy at ISI-Kolkata,  Prof. Debasis Mishra & Prof. Arunava Sen at ISI-Delhi etc.,** but from an Economics standpoint. In my search, **I've also found that there exists an opportunity of pursuing a part-time PhD at ISI-Kolkata/Delhi & IITs - Kanpur, Delhi etc.,** which has got me very excited and made me revive my plan to pursue PhD.

  
In this regard, while continuing my preparation for UPSC-CSE to appear in 2023 (**Prelims - May'23, Mains - Sept'23**), I've also started to pick up the basics of Economics from **Oct'22** with the help of M.A. Economics at IGNOU (as I could get a M.A. degree remotely) and gave my 1st year exams in **Dec'22-Jan'23**.   
But UPSC-CSE exam being extremely demanding in memory and time, I'm unable to complete the foundations required well within the time to appear for ISI-JRF(QE) exam being held in **May'23**, especially reading Macro, Econometrics etc., appears more than my interests for now due to my time being constrained. UPSC-Prelims is also being conducted in the same month as ISI-JRF (QE) in **May'23**.   
As **I'm aiming to secure a top rank in the final list without a compromise**, **I have decided to go back on ISI-JRF (QE) searching for alternatives which would allow me to take an admission in a part-time PhD program starting from Sept'23,** soon after I finish with my UPSC-CSE (Mains) exam.   
By this, I will also get more than enough time to concretely build my foundations in Economic Theory. **Above all, it would provide me enough time (till Sept'23) to read some papers and also pick up the trending research directions in the subjects - Mechanism Design, Game Theory, Choice & Decision Theory etc.**.  

  
**How will a part-time PhD benefit me, as I will be joining Civil Services ?** 

I will be choosing **Indian Foreign Service** as my first cadre preference, where working in strategic environments happens to be the core aspect of the job. Even though the work may not be directly related to the research work I wish to do in (**Mechanism Design, Game Theory,  Choice, Decision Theory etc.** **primarily**, if possible some other areas in Maths & TCS as well), it would provide enough on ground insights which can be aligned with above research topics. Also, a PhD work relating to such strategic analysis would make me a front runner in leading either the Economics/Political Wings within the Indian Foreign Service.   
**By pursuing part-time while being in the service, I shall be secure and not have to worry about career & family etc. much, and can pursue research whole-heartedly with dedication.** 

**As I will be joining the service (IFS) in Aug'24, I would only seek assistance or fellowship for the period Sept'23 to Aug'24, after that other than access to journals, travel grants and book-purchases, I won't be needing any kind of monetary assistance for my part-time PhD pursuit.**  
  
Finally, to conclude, I've always been a theory enthusiast starting from my Bachelors (when working for my thesis identifying [mistakes](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hmHOy27Xk3FgPk-aof9BHi59bLE3XmL4/view) in the algorithm of an IEEE-TPAMI [Paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6891337) -  A+ rating ML Theory Journal in 2015-16 (now it's NeurIPS)), till today in the intersection of **Maths, Theoretical CS & Economics etc.** areas, pursuing a PhD was always part of my plan, it was only the matter of time (when) that has changed.
