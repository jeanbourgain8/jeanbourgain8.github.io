## 1. Background Information

I started my research pursuit with [Bio-Medical Devices & Imaging](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1baLe5P9N5wIfxbIhuJDW9uw_jOTpaQQU/view?usp=sharing), [Instrumentation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IwRRM0X6Xsn-6FphBChUmscy894OCHYl/view) and have travelled a long road experimenting in different areas - [Machine Learning](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LS3Y6dzPuQ-YZN2ZHMHlZPWwNeGkSEyo/view?usp=sharing) ([Applied](https://github.com/anhttran/3dmm_cnn) [&](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1y33JUi8W0MT1X8cHpywhF-WbSSGmsKKO?usp=sharing) [Theory](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hmHOy27Xk3FgPk-aof9BHi59bLE3XmL4/view)), [3D](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.00523v1.pdf) -  [Face](https://flame.is.tue.mpg.de/), [Body](https://smpl-x.is.tue.mpg.de/) [Reconstruction](https://grail.cs.washington.edu/projects/AudioToObama/), SLAM (typically called as [NERFs](https://grail.cs.washington.edu/projects/personnerf/) recently) etc. where some happened to be co-incidental (includes job at HPE) with the trends and others well thought ones (like exploring Theory). 

It was only in Jun'2019, I have concretely realized that my interests primarily lie in the intersection of Maths, Theoretical CS & Economics subjects, and resolved to pursue research in these subjects for the coming next 10-15 years. I was supposed to join in one of Masters CS programs starting from June'2019 but for some specific reasons, and also having realized by then already that I like Theory a lot more than the Applied aspects of research, I have dropped my masters plan abroad (avoiding to spend any huge sums) and chose the path of Civil Services with a plan to do a PhD down the line after 5-7 years being in the service (which is allowed complying with the service rules).

# Statement of Purpose
---

## 1. Introduction 

To my fortune, I have found a great **possibility** in **Sept'2022**, which was the same month in which I gave my UPSC-CSE (Mains) Exam in 2022. The **possibility** has profoundly excited me to an extent that I was even ready to deliberately flunk my exam (only to appear again in next year - 2023). Till then, I have half-heartedly accepted & planned to delay my research pursuit for 5-7 years to comply with the rules of govt. (min. time one should spend in the service to obtain a study leave), but this discovery of a **possibility** has **rekindled** my spirit to pursue research without having to delay it any further.   
Prior to this discovery, my original plan was to appear in UPSC-CSE (for IAS/IFS), finish my M.A. Economics at IGNOU so that I can appear for Indian Economic Services as a backup option.  

Now, naturally it might occur to you when I'm so interested in research with so many opportunities existing today, be it at Google/Microsoft/Amazon Research and many other MNCs to work on Electronic Commerce/Algos/Networks etc. 

**Why don't I pursue research single-mindedly and become a Research Scientist/Professor ?**

In Jun'2019, I have made a steadfast decision to work for the state (govt.) as an organisation in an administrative position be it either in Administrative/Foreign Services and pursue research as a **habit** (**not as a hobby**; but **with dedication**). Also, the fact that I find it very hard & contrasting to my personality, to dedicate myself to one particular area/subject for an extended period of time (>15+ yrs) has completely ruled out the option for me to even think of becoming a full-time professor. That's why, to work for the state in an administrative capacity & also to retain felixibility in my breadth of interests - Maths, Theoretical CS & Economics etc., I have chosen this particular path - Civil Services + Research (as a habit).
  
## 2. Theoretical Economics $\succcurlyeq$ Theoretical CS

I have observed that ISI-Delhi provides an unique opportunity, though not recommended, it is open to a possibility for people to pursue their PhD remotely (not full-time). In my enquiry, I have come to know that there are people who are pursuing/have pursued research **part-time** (Ex: Leena Kumar etc.). **Now, this possibility has come as an absolute blessing to me**. I do not have to wait/delay my plan of pursuing research any further for 5-7 years.   

***Note**: By part-time I only mean to indicate the constraint of time but not its seriousness.*

After spending some time working on projects till Jun'2019 to resolve the dilemma of my future pursuit between Theory & Applied aspects of Machine Learning, I have realised that my inclination was more towards Theory. Since then, I've been exploring (briefly) theory in different areas apart from Machine Learning within the Computer Science (Algorithmic Game Theory, Approximation Algos, Graph Theory & Combinatorics etc.), keeping myself updated with the new materials, directions and trends. 

Recently, after re-aligning my interests with Economics as primary focus from Theoretical CS in **Sept'22**,  **I have found ISI-Delhi with You & Prof. Arunava Sen as crown jewels to my this new world**. Adding to this, "<ins><strong>the possibility of pursuing research remotely</strong></ins>" & "<ins><strong>positive comments from your students about your mentorship</strong></ins>" has only made the feeling more concrete. 

### 2.1 Why ISI-Delhi ? 

Besides the quantitative emphasis in research and convergence between my areas of interests with Prof. Debasis Mishra's works & experience, I believe that, doing a PhD at ISI would provide me an access to excellent research world community and equip me with tools and network in transforming myself succesfully into a Theoretical Economist. Also professionally, while working in the service (IFS), ISI being an Indian University would allow me to do a PhD simultaneously with minimal interference/restrictions from the govt. side. In every way, starting with You & Prof. Arunava Sen, institute's quality of research, its norms and independence etc., for many such reasons, I cannot of think of any institute other than ISI -Delhi which can fit perfectly well with my aspirations. Hence, I named the title of this post as **"My Tryst with ISI-Delhi"**. 

### 2.2 Why Prof. Debasis Mishra ? 

In my observation, Prof. Debasis Mishra as much an Microeconomic Theorist he is, I have also found him having an inclination towards theoretical aspects outside of economics, related to his areas - Maths, CS etc., I have deduced this based on some of my observations such as, **his research in Mechanism Design, Game Theory** (Multi-Agents) areas (which always has influx of students from other fields, but, recently it is seeing an increasing influx of CS students), **his stint at IISC-CSA after his PhD**, **his past association with Davic C. Parkes** (positive indication) who is currently leading a group working on Economics & Computation etc., **a few more such observations  gaurentee me that I can flex/experiment ocassionally beyond Microeconomics during my PhD**. In addition, while picking up economic analysis concepts from him, in exchange I shall provide new insights/ideas due to some of my prior experience & inclinations being in areas outside economics. 

Positive comments from his previous PhD students & same alma mater add a sense of security in the case of any exigencies that may arise during my PhD (Ex: My current plan to take a delayed admission into the PhD program).

For the above and other unmentioned reasons, I strongly feel that he will be a perfect advisor for me to succesfully transform into a Theoretical Economist. Added bonus is, I can also seek some guidance from Prof. Arunava Sen for choice concepts which is why ISI-Delhi is simply a perfect fit for me. 

### 2.3 Why a PhD ?

**"Okay, shouldn't this be talked at first ?!"**,   
**Hmmm, Yes!**, this is a reverse of usual order - **Why ? Who ? Where ?**   

As I have established above, I made a steadfast decision to become part of the either Administrative/Foreign services for some valid reasons in Jun'2019. But that doesn't mean I have to forgo my interest for research in theory, it was just some compromise (half-heartedly done) I had to accept for the decisions I took. I accepted & chose to delay my PhD for 5-7 years after getting into the service. 

I guess, partly this half-hearted acceptance is also a reason for my delay in clearing the UPSC-CSE. I was unable to give my complete attention to the exam because I never felt getting into the services would complete me, rather I chose it because it would provide me an opportunity to formulate & take decisions over problems concerning at large and also have a predictable future to pursue my interests independently.  

Since I started exploring theory in Jun'2019, I've been following works of some professors, a small subset I am mentioning here below.

<br>
Prahlad Harsha & Othrs. at TIFR, Siddharth Barman (Fair Division) at IISC & groups working at Google & Microsoft Research in India, U.Penn (Sampath Kannan), UW (Anna Karlin, Sebastien Bubeck, Yin-Tat-Lee etc.), UCSD (UIUC (Jugal Garg, Ruta Mehta etc.), Princeton (Matt Weinberg etc.), Harvard (Madhusudhan etc.), CMU (Pradeep Ravikumar, Venkatesh Guruswami etc.) and many other groups at MIT (Constantis Daskalias etc.), Columbia (Tim Roughgarden etc.), UW-Madison (Nowak, Suchi Chawla moved to UT-Austin etc.), Stanford (Andrea Montanari, etc.) & people at many others places - UWaterloo, Toronto, Oxford, ETHZ, EPFL etc.

Among them, I have found directions of Prof. Siddharth Barman at IISC interesting within India. So, I have put him at the top of my list to work with, if and when I plan to pursue PhD in future. Now, in **Sept'22** when I found that similar works are being done from Economics standpoint at ISI-Delhi, I felt very excited. In addition, the flexibility of ISI-Delhi program to work remotely has right away fixated me to it. All of a sudden, I re-configured all my career plans and revived my PhD plan, which earlier has been pushed down, to pursue it 5-7 years later. 

So yeah, PhD has always been part of the plan, it's just the matter of time that's changed.  


# Administrative (IAS) vs Foreign (IFS) Services
---

Now, I'll come to the cherry on top aspect of this entire PhD plan. While entering the UPSC-CSE journey, I wanted to become part of the Administrative Service (IAS) more than Foreign Service (IFS) but later after realising the demands of work beyond usual hours in the initials year of Administrative Services has caused me to rethink, because some personal time for me to pursue either science or my other interests is non-negotiable to me, I felt that part of freedom is something hard for me to forgo. Yet, I've sticked to pursue IAS coming to a compromise that I can pursue reasearch after 5-7 years by taking a study leave. 

But this discovery of a possibility to do a PhD at ISI-Delhi, has reinvigorated my spirit and changed all my plans. I changed my first preference to Foreign Services.  As I'm aware of, the initial years though demand responsibility but they aren't as demanding as IAS, one will find enough time to pursue their interests while being in the service.

**The Cherry of this PhD Plan:** The change of my primary area of research from Theoretical CS to Theoretical Economics - Mechanism Design, Game Theory, Choices, Auctions, Networks etc., all of these topics concern with the operations happening in strategic environments, which exactly is what happens to be my job as IFS. This convergence of my research and professional interests is a blessing. Also, by obtaining a PhD in Economics, I will get to lead the Economics Wing within the Foreign Services Divisions. 

**Thus, in the end, all my personal, professional & all kinds of interests have converged altogether into one beautiful circle.**
