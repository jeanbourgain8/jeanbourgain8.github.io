<h1 id="need-some-extra-time">Need some extra time</h1>
<p>In <strong>Oct'22</strong>, working towards joining the PhD program at ISI-Delhi, I have started with pursuing M.A. Economics course at IGNOU for picking up the basics. I felt it was the best option available for me to do remotely, simultaneously I would also earn a degree. If in case, not even in my wildest dreams would I let it happen, but if anything goes wrong with the UPSC-CSE, I can appear for Indian Economic Services (for which M.A. Economics is a compulsory) as a backup option. </p>
<p>Though the ISI-JRF (QE) exam primarily focuses on foundational depth with some deducable patterns existing in the questions asked - Utility Maximization, Theory of Choice, Econometrics Basics + Dev Econ., Time Series Basics, Growth Models, Nash &amp; Sub-Perfect Nash Equilibrium. I came across some instances where the terminologies appearing in the exam which are not quite common at the very first instance for someone like me who just got started in Oct'22 (Ex: $2^{nd}$ Question's Perfect Labour Mobility in QEB, 2018 etc.) .</p>
<p>If not for both ISI-JRF &amp; IGNOU exams, I would have strictly confined to Microeconomic Theory and covered as much material as possible restricting myself exclusively to the following topics at first - <strong>Theory of Choice, Equilibrium &amp; Welfare, Game Theory, Mechanism Design, Auction Theory etc.</strong>, by starting with Prof. Debasis Mishra's notes for the foundations build up.<br>
But lately, I have a feeling that I will need some extra time inorder to cover these topics more extensively &amp; concretely, especially with UPSC-CSE preparation heavily constraing my time and also to fill my knowledge gaps in Econometrics (despite my prior familiarity with Max. Likelihood, Regression etc. in Machine Learning) &amp; Macroeconomic Theory (itself being broad).<br>
I may have completed 1st year M.A. Economics - IGNOU exams already in Dec'22-Jan'23, but I did not find their materials sufficient enough to cover the breadth &amp; depth needed. I found them more verbose.

<summary>[Click to Expand] <strong>Clash of UPSC - CSE, ISI-JRF (QE), Indian Economic Services, 2nd year M.A. Economics - IGNOU Exams </strong></summary>
<br>
UPSC-CSE being primarily a memory-based exam and me aiming for securing a top-rank in it, consumes a major portion of my day-time. In addition, its Mathematics Syllabus is broad with depth (almost equivalent to M.Sc Level). If it is not for Mathematics & its vast syllabus (advantage is, fetches more & sure marks), UPSC-CSE would have been relatively easier to be done away with.  <br>
All of these exams happening around the same months is making it quite difficult for me to optimally allocate my attention & memory to obtain the best results in all of them. <br>
To my luck/bad-luck, the dates of 2nd year M.A. Economics exams of IGNOU and Indian Economic Services are clashing. Preparation for these two is requiring a lot of my memory more than the others. <br>
So, due to their sheer size in material and also the clashing of dates, I have decided not to appear for Indian Economic Services Exam this year & postponed my plan to give my 2nd year M.A. Economics exams of IGNOU to Dec'2023. <br>
With this, only two exams remain - UPSC-CSE (Prelims in May'23 & Mains in Sept'23) & ISI-JRF (in May'23) to tackle currently, yet, both being in May'2023 (UPSC - Prelims) with contrasting demands of the subjects, especially memory management which is heaviy required for UPSC-CSE still continues to be a huge challenge. <br>
In addition to these, QEA of ISI-JRF (QE) requires Probability & Statistics, Optimization etc. (though not very deeply), UPSC-CSE (Maths) held in Sept'23 demands primary focus on ODEs, PDEs, Mathematical Physics - Mechanics, Fluid Dynamics, Group Theory, Real Analysis etc., with only Linear Algebra & Calculus being common to both.

All in all, despite cutting down the number of exams (<strong>UPSC-CSE, ISI-JRF, UPSC-IES, 2nd yr @ M.A. - IGNOU</strong>) to appear in to two, <strong>UPSC-CSE &amp; ISI-JRF</strong> both still being quite demanding in subjects breadth within this very less time, it has become quite difficult for me to find a way to manage &amp; work towards producing the best results in both, especially to secure a top rank in UPSC-CSE when preparing without any established guidance.<br>
To address this problem, I have found a solution but I wanted to check them with you and verify before I proceed. So, I have made a blog post mentioning them <a href="link://slug/2023-03-05-05:47:55">here</a>. Please Check.</p>
