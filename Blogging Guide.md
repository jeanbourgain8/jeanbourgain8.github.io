## Process Flow
### When Writing Posts
- Decide if the post is going to be on blog/substack, 
	- if blog, then use category as blog, write description & add a teaser before proceeding
	- if substack, write without teaser & description sections, add status private

### When Publishing Posts
- Change the status of posts from private to public using sublime text & update the feeds in Substack, after publishing in substack change back the status public to private & re-deploy blogsite
