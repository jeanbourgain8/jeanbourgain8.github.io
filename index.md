		<p>2) In <a href="https://upscdots.substack.com/"><strong>Connecting Collector</strong></a>, I post my daily <strong>answer-writings</strong> as an account of my answer-writings to track my progress, I can see <a href="https://upscdots.substack.com/"><strong>Connecting Collector</strong></a> becoming a comprehensive resource on answer-writing for <strong>UPSC  Aspirants </strong> & also as a good collection to the General Audience, who are genuinely interested in knowing the contours of <strong>development of India</strong>, as a nation & society.</p>
