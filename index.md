I'm **Hasanth**.

In this [**blog**](https://jeanbourgain8.github.io/), I write articles on topics - ***Theoretical Computer Science, Maths, Competitve Programming, System hacks & other technical stuff,*** which I expect would serve both as - an account of my thoughts, progress & also as a comprehensive knowledge resource, for the interested. 

In addition, I also publish on [**substack**](https://jeanbourgain8.substack.com/), on topics which are of more general concern - ***Public Policy, Economics, Psychology, Book Reviews/Summaries etc.,*** some of them are for free to read & to access the rest you need to subscribe.
